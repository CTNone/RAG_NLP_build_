In Cavanaugh, Pitt has a well-versed\noffensive mind who has experience on both the\npro and college levels.\nOverseeing a unit rife with youth last year, the\nPanthers produced their first 1,000-yard rusher in\nseven years. Tailback LeSean McCoy rushed for a\nBigEast freshman record 1,328 yards and topped\nall freshman runners nationally with 110.67 yards\nper game.\nMcCoy set Pitt freshman records for points(90)\nand rushing touchdowns (14), surpassingthe\nlegendary Tony Dorsett’s 34-year-old marks (78 points, 13 rushing TDs in 1973).\nIn 2006, Pitt ranked among the nation’s top 20 in three different major offensive categories, including\npass efficiency (third, 166.79 rating), scoring (14th, 31.75 points per game) and passing (20th, 249.25 yards\nper game). Pitt’s scoring average of nearly 32 points per game that season was its highest in 25 years. Only\nthe Panthers’ 1981 edition, which averaged 32.1 points under quarterback Dan Marino, scored at a higher\nclip during that span.\nIndividually, quarterback Tyler Palko, now with the New Orleans Saints, was a major beneficiary of\nCavanaugh’s guidance. As a senior, Palko led the Big East and ranked fourth in the country in pass\nefficiency (163.25). He finished his career ranked second all-time at Pitt in total offense (8,429) and\ntouchdown passes (tied with 66) and additionally finished third in career passing yards (8,343).\nCavanaugh has renewed ties with Dave Wannstedt for the third time. Wannstedt was an assistant on\nthe Pitt staff during the final three years of Cavanaugh’s sparkling collegiate career from 1974-77. The\npair also worked together in the NFL when Wannstedt was the head coach of the Chicago Bears and\nCavanaugh his offensive coordinator.\nCavanaugh will forever be remembered in Panther lore for quarterbacking Pitt to the 1976 national\nchampionship. He capped that magical season with an MVP performance in the Sugar Bowl, leading Pittsburgh\nto a 27-3 demolition of Georgia. Cavanaugh scored the first touchdown of the game and the celebration of that\nscore became a Sports Illustratedcover (Jan. 10, 1977), which is still displayed at several locales on campus.\nHis effective blend of passing and running made him an All-American in 1977 and his 3,378 career\npassing yards still rank 13th in Pitt annals.\nHe returned to Pittsburgh in 2005 with an impressive resume as a player and coach on both the\ncollegiate and professional levels. In addition to his collegiate championship, Cavanaugh earned three\nSuper Bowl rings, including two as a player (with the San Francisco 49ers in 1984 and the New York\nGiants in 1990) and one as a coach (Baltimore Ravens in 2000).\nA native of Youngstown, Ohio, and graduate of Chaney High, Cavanaugh spent 14 years as a\nquarterback in the National Football League. A second-round selection of New England in 1978, he spent\nfive seasons (1978-82) with the Patriots before moving on to stints with the San Francisco 49ers (1983-85),\nPhiladelphia Eagles (1986-89) and New York Giants (1990-91).\nCavanaugh began his coaching career at Pitt, where he served as tight ends coach for John Majors in\n1993. He then moved back to the NFL, serving as quarterbacks coach for the Arizona Cardinals from\n1994-95 and at San Francisco in 1996. From 1997-98, Cavanaugh was offensive coordinator for Chicago,\nserving under Wannstedt, who was the Bears’ head coach. He then was the offensive coordinator at\nBaltimore (1999-2004), where during the Ravens’ Super Bowl season he orchestrated a rushing attack that\nproduced a franchise-record 2,199 yards.\nCavanaugh earned his bachelor’s degree from Pitt in administration of justice.\nPROFILES PANTHER\nPersonal Information\nBORN10/27/56\nHOMETOWNYoungstown, Ohio\nALMA MATERPittsburgh, ’79\nFAMILYCavanaugh’s wife’s name is Maria.\nHe is the father of three children: Amy, Andrew\nand Mollie.\nCoaching Experience\nPROFESSIONAL\nARIZONA,1994-95, quarterbacks.\nSAN FRANCISCO,1996, quarterbacks.\nCHICAGO,1997-98, offensive coordinator.\nBALTIMORE,1999-2004, offensive coordinator.\nCOLLEGE\nPITTSBURGH,1993, tight ends; 2005-present,\noffensive coordinator & quarterbacks.\nFOOTBALL\nSTAFF\nTHIS\nIS\nPITT\n2008\nPREVIEW\nCOACHING\nMatt and Maria Cavanaugh with Ruby.PHIL BENNETT\nDEFENSIVE COORDINATOR\nPHIL BENNETT,a three-decade veteran\nof the college coaching ranks and a\nformer national “Coordinator of the\nYear” honoree, was named defensive\ncoordinator at the University of\nPittsburgh in February.
