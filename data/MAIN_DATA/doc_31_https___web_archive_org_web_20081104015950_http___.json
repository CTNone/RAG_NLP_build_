The upper bound of 150 is the facility-called rate, whereas the lower\nbounds are the modeled benchmarks for these configurations.\n• Note that these benchmarks do not always represent balanced operations – there may be\nmore departures than arrivals in the Marginal and IFR scenarios. If the facility reported rates\nare significantly unbalanced (i.e., unequal numbers of arrivals and departures), the\nbenchmark rates will be unbalanced as well. The facility reported rates reflect current\noperations at the airport during a busy hour, but such unbalanced rates cannot be sustained\nfor extended periods.\n• Planned technological improvements at PIT would slightly increase the arrival peak capacity\nin Marginal conditions. The benefit in Marginal conditions assumes that suitably equipped\naircraft can use CEFR to maintain visual separations, thus allowing the airport to realize the\nOptimum rate arrival capacity in Marginal conditions.\n• The following charts compare actual hourly traffic with the calculated capacity curves for\nPIT.\nThese values were calculated for the Capacity Benchmarking task and should not be used for other\npurposes, particularly if more detailed analyses have been performed for the airport or for the\nindividual programs.\nThe list of Planned Improvements and their expected effects on capacity does not imply FAA\ncommitment to or approval of any item on the list.\nPIT-2PITTSBURGH – Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT)\nWeather Scenario Configuration Procedures Benchmark Rate\n(per hour)\nArrivals on Runways 28R, 32\nDepartures on 28L, 28R\nOptimum Rate Today 152-160\nFrequency of Use: 61% in\noptimum conditions\nCeiling and visibility\nVisual approaches,\nabove minima for visual\napproaches (1800 ft New Runway N/A visual separation N/A\nceiling and 3 mi visibility)\nPlanned improvements\nOccurrence: 86% Same 152\n(2013)\nArrivals on Runways 28L, 28R\nDepartures on 28C, 28R\nMarginal Rate Today 143-150\nFrequency of Use: 51% in\nInstrument\nmarginal conditions\napproaches, radar\nBelow visual approach separation\nminima but better than New Runway N/A N/A\ninstrument conditions\nPlanned improvements Visual approaches,\nOccurrence: 5% Same 152\n(2013) visual separation\nArrivals on Runways 28L, 28R\nDepartures on 28C, 28R\nIFR Rate Today 119-150\nFrequency of Use: 64% in IFR\nconditions\nInstrument\nInstrument conditions\n(ceiling < 1000 ft or New Runway N/A approaches, radar N/A\nvisibility < 3.0 miles) separation\nPlanned improvements\nOccurrence: 9% Same 130\n(2013)\nNOTE: Data on frequency of occurrence of weather and runway configuration usage is based on FAA ASPM data for\nJanuary 2000 to July 2002 (excluding 11-14 September 2001), 7 AM to 10 PM local time.\nPlanned Improvements at PIT include:\n• CEFR, for reduced in-trail separations between arrivals in Marginal conditions.\n• Revised wake vortex procedures, to increase arrival throughput on closely spaced parallel runways.\nHowever, this improvement does not affect the configurations modeled\nAdditional information on these improvements may be found in the Introduction and Overview of this\nreport, under “Assumptions.”\n.\nPIT-3PITTSBURGH – Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT)\nCalculated Capacity (Today) and Actual Throughput\nOptimum Rate\nMarginal Rate IFR Rate\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nDepartures per Hour\nPIT-4\nruoH\nrep\nslavirrA\n120\n100\n70,80\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nDepartures per Hour\nruoH\nrep\nslavirrA\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nDepartures per Hour\n70,80\nruoH\nrep\nslavirrA\nCalculated Capacity - Today\n80,80 Facility Reported Rate - PIT\n(arrivals, departures per hr)\nInfrequent Most Frequent\nEach symbol represents actual traffic\nduring a single hour\nHourly traffic data was obtained from the FAA ASPM database for January 2000 to July 2002 (excluding 11-14\nSeptember 2001), 7 AM to 10 PM local time.
