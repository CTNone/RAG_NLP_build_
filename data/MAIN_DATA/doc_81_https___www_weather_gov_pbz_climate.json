Outlook\n8-14 Day Outlook\nTemperature\nPrecipitation\nTemperature\nPrecipitation\nTemperature and precipitation outlooks for the 6-10 day and 8-14 day periods. Issued daily by the NOAA/NWS Climate Prediction Center. The outlooks express forecast probability that temperatures or total precipitation in the 6-10 or 8-14 day period will tend to be similar to the 10-highest (\"above-normal\"), middle-10 (\"near-normal\"), or 10-lowest (\"below-normal\") observed in the 1981-2010 normals period. Color shading on the outlook maps follows standard convention for warmer/colder or wetter/drier, with near-normal in white. Darker shades of red or blue (or green and brown) indicate a higher forecast probability.\nOne Month Outlook\nThree Month Outlook\nTemperature\nPrecipitation\nTemperature\nPrecipitation\nOne Month and Three-Month temperature and precipitation outlooks. The outlooks are issued by the Climate Prediction Center on the last day of each month (valid for the following month), with an update to the outlook on the third Thursday of the following month. The monthly and seasonal outlooks are similar to the 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks. However, in areas where \"Equal Chances\" (EC) is shown, it means that climate signals do not favor either above- or below-normal, and above-, near-, or below-normal forecast categories are equally likely to occur. A forecast of Equal Chances does NOT necessarily mean forecast conditions are expected to be near-normal.\nThis page provides an overview of tornado climatology for the Pittsburgh, PA (PBZ) CWA since 1950.

Flash Floods can also occur due to excessive runoff from melting snow, ice jams, or Dam/Levee Breaks.\nThe intensity and location/distribution of rainfall plays a significant factor in flash flooding, but other factors that contribute are land use, soil type, topography, vegetation type/density, and soil water-content. These all determine if and how quickly Flash Flooding may occur.\nUrban areas within our forecast area are also prone to flash flooding in short time-spans as the impervious surfaces in the urban areas do not allow water to infiltrate the ground, and the water runs off to the low spots very quickly. Clogged drains and culverts within urban settings can further exacerbate flooding problems.\nIt is important to view these severe weather reports as just that, reports. We rely heavily on Skywarn Spotters, Broadcast Media, Cooperative Observers, County Officials, and the Public for severe weather reports. While we remain diligent in our efforts to document every occurence of flooding, we understand that a lot of cases go unrecorded.\nClick on each thumbnail to view the larger image\nFlash Flood Reports by County\nFlash Flood Reports by Year\nFlash Flood Reports by Month\nFlash Flood Reports by Month (with PBZ Precipitable Water Climatology\n)\nTwo maximas are noted in the monthly graphs, a warm season spike (May-Aug) and a cool season spike (Jan). This shows that there are multiple factors at play. The warm season maxima is associated with thunderstorm activity over the Spring and Summer months when precipitatable water (the total amount of water in the column of atmosphere overhead) peaks and heavy downpours are common with thunderstorms. The right image contains the precipitable water climatology data derived from the Pittsburgh Upper Air Sounding. The cool season maxima can at least be partially attributed to rain falling on melting snow and/or ice jam issues.\nFlash Flood Reports by Hour\nTwo maximas are noted in the hourly graphs, an afternoon/evening spike (2-5pm EST) and a morning spike (6-9am EST). The afternoon/evening spike is a result of what you may expect, heavy downpours associated with thunderstorms that develop during the peak heating hours. The morning spike may actually be attributed more to human nature than environmental factors. This is the time of day when most people are travelling and may encounter a flooded roadway, either from earlier rainfall or from rain falling at that time.\nLocal Resources:\nSearchable Local Climate Data\nPreliminary Pittsburgh, PA Local Climatological Data (LCD)\nPreliminary Morgantown, WV Local Climatological Data (LCD)\nPreliminary Zanesville, OH Local Climatological Data (LCD)\nPreliminary Wheeling, WV Local Climatological Data (LCD)\nPreliminary New Philadelphia, OH Local Climatological Data (LCD)\nHurricane and Tropical Storm Remnant Historical Information\nGroundhog Day Climate Information\nSunrise/Sunset Tabular Data\nRegional Resources:\nPennsylvania State Climatologist\nOhio State Climatologist\nWest Virginia State Climatologist\nNortheast Regional Climate Center\nMidwest Regional Climate Center\nInteractive Frost/Freeze Information\nNational Resources:\nNWS/NOAA Climate Prediction Center\nNOAA-CIRES Climate Diagnostic Center\nNOAA El Nino page\nNOAA Climate Resources\nRadar\nCurrent Weather\nRivers & Lakes\nSatellite\nForecast Maps\nHour by Hour Forecast\nTropical Weather\nGraphical Hazards\nWeather Hazards Briefing\nSkywarn\nReport Severe Weather\nText Bulletins\nForecaster's Discussion\nAviation\nFire Weather\nClimate Data\nSevere Weather Climatology\nNOAA Weather Radio\nFollow us on X\nFollow us on Facebook\nPBZ RSS Feed\nForecast\nPIT Weather Radio\nPIT Hydrology\nSun/Moon\nNational Fire Weather\nSevere Weather\nHurricanes\nRiver/Stream\nNational Marine\nNational Aviation\nGraphical\nDiscussions\nNBM 1D Viewer\nAstronomical Data\nPIT Fire Weather\nPIT Aviation Page\nEnhanced Hazardous Weather Outlook\nHydrology\nPIT Hydrology Page\nOhio River Forecast Center\nNational Office of Water Prediction\nReports\nPublic Information Statement\nWinter Weather\nReport Severe Weather\nLocal Storm Reports\nClimate\nPast Weather\nPA State Climatologist\nClimate Predictions\nPast Events\nLocal Climate Page\nSkywarn\nSkywarn Page\nWhat is Skywarn?\nSkywarn Meetings\nHam Radio Frequencies\nHam Radio Program\nWeather Safety\nNOAA Weather Radio\nPittsburgh Weather Radio\nBrochures\nFEMA\nRed Cross\nDamage/Fatality/Injury Statistics\nThunderstorm Safety\nAir Quality\nWinter Safety\nTurn Around Don't Drown\nFlood Safety\nTornado Safety\nLightning Safety\nHeat Safety\nStorm Ready\nUV (Sun) Safety\nOffice Programs\nPittsburgh Facebook Page\nPittsburgh X Feed\nCoOP\nMeteorological Calculator\nOnline Office Tour\nSocial Media Feeds\nOffice History\nNWS News\nSocial Media\nEvents\nNWS News\nPubs/Brochures/Booklets\nOrganizational Information\nAbout\nGlossary\nProducts and Services\nNational Centers\nNOAA International\nContact Us\nUS Dept of Commerce\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nNational Weather Service\nPittsburgh, PA\n192 Shafer Road\nMoon Township, PA 15108\n412-262-2170\nComments?
