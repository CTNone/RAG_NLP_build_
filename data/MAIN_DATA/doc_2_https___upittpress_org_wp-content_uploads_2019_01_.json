All rights reserved.41\nfig. 2.1\nThe Golden\nTriangle\nO\nf the various claims about who first likened downtown Pittsburgh\nto a Golden Triangle, one has primacy. After the Great Fire of 1845\nravaged the city’s core, Mayor William Howard is said to have\ndeclared, “We shall make of this triangle of blackened ruins a golden triangle\nwhose fame will endure as a priceless heritage.”\nThe Golden Triangle nickname was already well established locally by\n1914, when an article in the Saturday Evening Post gave it national publicity.\nThe nickname was a good fit because the 255 acres bounded by Grant\nStreet and the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers must count among the\nmost gilded in the United States, having generated immense wealth. The\nTriangle constitutes a city in itself, with retail strips on Wood and Smithfield\nstreets and Forbes and Fifth avenues, a government center on Grant, two\nchurches and the Duquesne Club on Sixth Avenue, and extensive cultural\nfacilities set among the cast-iron fronts and loft buildings on Penn and\nLiberty avenues.\nThe compactness of the Golden Triangle is a marvel in its own right: no\ntwo of its points are more than a fifteen-minute walk apart. The subway route\nfrom Grant Street to Gateway Center is so tiny that its entire length is shorter\nthan the subway platform beneath Times Square in New York.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.Being so small, downtown Pittsburgh is the preserve of pedestrians. In\nwinter, they tend to stay indoors by using the subway and the tunnels, atri-\nums, and interior streets of the new buildings. During the other seasons\nthey move outdoors and enjoy Point State Park or Market Square, which has\n42\nbeen hosting public gatherings since 1784. At noon every day, lunch crowds\ndescend on Mellon Square, PPG Place, PNC Plaza, or the plazas set around\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW the U.S. Steel tower and 625 Liberty. PPG Place was designed as a contem-\nPORTRAIT\nporary variant of Paris’s Place Vendôme, but its main attraction now is a\nfountain that doubles in winter as an ice-skating rink.\nThe remaking of the Triangle during the Pittsburgh Renaissance of the\n1950s was a closely guarded process, led by Richard King Mellon and\nMayor David L. Lawrence with a largely self-taught staff under Park Martin,\nWallace Richards, and John Robin. The upgrading of the Triangle in the\n1980s (the so-called Renaissance II) was, by contrast, a technocratic rather\nthan an autocratic process, with Mayor Richard Caliguiri and the Urban\nRedevelop ment Authority devising the urban upgrades. The results were\nnevertheless substantial: the subway, cosmetic improvements to Grant Street,\nthe first Lawrence Convention Center (even though it was a functional and\nartistic dis appointment), Liberty Center, Oxford Centre, Mellon Center,\nPPG Place, Chatham Center II, Fifth Avenue Place, and 625 Liberty in the\nTriangle, with spin-off developments in the Strip, the South Side, and the\nNorth Side. These renewal efforts involved about five times as much build-\ning as in the original Renaissance projects in the 1950s.\nfig. 2.2\nThe Fountain\nat the Point\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

No longer just a place to which business people commute, it has\nrecently become home to some three thousand residents, with up to five\ntimes that number projected to move Downtown in the decade beginning in\n2010. Across the whole of Downtown and in the adjacent Strip, dozens of\nolder buildings have been converted to student dormitories, apartments, or\ncondominiums.\nParking remains a hurdle to Downtown redevelopment, not so much in its\nscarcity as its cost. (However, you can park all day in downtown Pittsburgh\nfor the price of a half hour in midtown Manhattan.) Retail is spotty: the sub-\nurban malls get most of the trade, and the only large department store still in\nDowntown is the Macy’s that was Kaufmann’s for 135 years. Only one movie\ntheater remains from the dozen of a century ago. Overall, though, entertain-\nment and the arts are flourishing Downtown. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust\nnow manages five updated theaters and concert halls in the Triangle: Heinz\nHall, Benedum Center, the Byham and O’Reilly theaters, and the Harris\nTheater, an art cinema. Finally diversified from its old state as a purely busi-\nness center, the Triangle’s current health is vigorous: where it leads, the rest\nof Pittsburgh will follow.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

All rights reserved.2 DOWNTOWN: A GOlDeN TriANGle\nThe pOiNT AND The mONONGAhelA riverfrONT\ni\nn 1868, Boston journalist James Parton wrote of Pittsburgh, “On that\nlow point of land, fringed now with steamboats and covered with grimy\nhouses, scarcely visible in the November fog and smoke, modern history 45\nbegan.” Not everyone would agree with Parton that “modern history” first\nannounced itself in Pittsburgh. Events of some importance also took place\nin Williams burg, Boston, and Philadelphia, not to mention Athens, Florence,\nand Runnymede. But the juncture of the Monongahela and Allegheny\nrivers — known as the Forks of the Ohio in the eighteenth century — was the\nsetting for three milestones. At that spot in 1758, North America was secured\nfor the British and not the French. In 1875, Andrew Carnegie’s revolutionary\nsteel mill secured the industrial might of the world for the United States and\nnot Europe. In 1945, there began one of the most striking rebirths of any city\nin the country.\nThe fifty-nine acres at the Forks of the Ohio are today split between\nPoint State Park and Gateway Center, together encompassing twelve office\nand residential towers, four bridges over land and water, two military strong-\nholds, and one of the world’s more vivid fountains. The views across the\nwater to the South Side and North Side capture the industrial history of\nPittsburgh, while on the land side stands Gateway Center, the starting point\nfor the city’s rebirth in the 1950s. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that\nwithout Gateway Center, the city might have withered to an unrecognizable\nhusk of its former glory.\nThe British intended Fort Pitt to be their stronghold in North America,\nand its construction became the first great accomplishment in Pittsburgh.\nWhen a military engineer, Captain Harry Gordon, devised it in 1759, he had\nthe benefit of three centuries of advancement in the science of fortifications,\ngoing all the way back to Renaissance Italy. Gordon gave the fort the shape\nof a slightly irregular pentagon with five pointed bastions. The bastions mini-\nmized cannon fire from direct broadside hits on the long sides and helped pin\ndown enemy troops before they could storm the walls. Two of the bastions\nhad walls nearly fifteen feet high and seven and a half feet thick. Those solid\nstone walls were faced with 1,244,160 bricks. The fortress walls were keyed\nto the kinds of attacks the British anticipated: on the land side, from which\ninfantry would attack, the walls were of brick and stone; facing the water,\nacross which cannon would fire, there were earthworks to absorb the blows.\nInside the fort was a parade ground with casemates (underground rooms\nframed in timber), magazines, and housing for a thousand men; outside was\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

The bricks were made\nlocally, the stone was quarried locally, and the timber was planed at a stream\nin Pittsburgh’s West End that has ever since been known as Saw Mill Run.\nLuckily, the greatest fort England ever built in the Western Hemisphere\n46\nwas put to the test only once, in Pontiac’s Rebellion of 1763. Despite its\nelegance, the fort had major problems. The river-oriented earthworks eroded\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW badly in the spring floods, and none of the bastions proved effective against\nPORTRAIT\nsnipers.\nIn 1764, dismayed by the fort’s poor performance, Colonel Henry\nBouquet constructed five redoubts outside its walls to catch snipers in cross-\nfire; one of them survives. Fort Pitt and the other four redoubts were allowed\nto tumble into ruins just one generation after the French threat ended. When\nthe Grenadier, Music, and Flag bastions were rebuilt in the 1950s, their plans\nand details were based on archaeological observations. Nonetheless, experts\nlater found fault with the restoration: the Music Bastion was not accurate, the\nbricks in the walls being mostly modern, and the moat opposite the Hilton\nHotel was narrower and shallower than the original. These charges were used\nas justification for filling in the moat in 2008 in order to expand the area for\nfig. 2.5\nconcerts and other public events.\nFort Pitt Block\nHouse, the The Block House, as Colonel Bouquet’s surviving pentagonal redoubt is\noldest structure\nmisnamed, still carries his name and the date 1764 inscribed over the door. It\nin Pittsburgh\nretains its original sandstone base, a complete rim of wooden girders, and\ncoursed common-bond brick walls. Iron cranking plates in the walls support\nthe upper floor, and the diminutive building bears a modern pyramidal roof\nof wooden shingles. This glimpse into American colonial history is the oldest\nsurviving structure in Pittsburgh.\nBy the first decades of the nineteenth century, Fort Pitt had been so\nthoroughly vandalized that even the earthen ramparts were gone. A few\nvoices suggested that the Point could be turned into the city’s first park, but\nthe fate of the site was sealed in 1854, when the Pennsylvania Railroad built the\nDuquesne Freight Depot directly over the ruins. It would take nearly a\ncentury for the city and state to redevelop the Point for shared use as a his-\ntoric park and an office complex. In 1947, while the development of Gateway\nCenter was being debated, Edgar J. Kaufmann gave Frank Lloyd Wright a\nnew commission (they had partnered to create Fallingwater a decade earlier).\nKaufmann wanted renderings for a circular megastructure thirteen levels\nhigh and one-fifth of a mile in diameter, with a helical auto ramp that would\nhave been four and a half miles long. Pittsburgh shied away from this over-\nsized vision of the future, which would have obliterated the historical relics\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

This episode supports the idea that history\nrepeats itself, since John Augustus Roebling had proposed a double suspen-\nsion bridge for the Point a century earlier.\n47\nGeorge Richardson, who engineered the Fort Pitt Bridge over the\nMonongahela and the Fort Duquesne Bridge over the Allegheny, was a mas-\nter of bridge design during his forty-year career in Pittsburgh and Allegheny\nCounty. Richardson and his design team transformed what might have been\na potentially ugly overpass connecting the two bridges into a luminous portal\nof three ultrathin stretched barrel vaults. The tensioning of the prestressed\nreinforcing rods in the concrete vaults was so complex that the final calcula-\ntions of 1962 were personally overseen by the celebrated French bridge\nbuilder Eugène Freyssinet just before his death that same year.\nThe eye-catching element in Point State Park turned out to be not its fort\nbut its fountain. All of the planners who had eyed the Point for a hundred\nyears imagined some focal element here. For Wright, it was a fountain; for\nRobert Moses, a shining beacon; for other visionaries it was a colossal sculp-\nture — of a steelworker, an allegorical Meeting of the Waters, or the legendary\nsteelworker Joe Magarac. (Legend holds that Magarac — which is Slovak for\n“jack-ass”— was the strongest steelworker in Pittsburgh. According to the\ntale, he would measure the consistency of a ladle of molten steel by tasting it\nand ended his life by leaping into a blast furnace to upgrade the quality of its\niron ore.) What emerged in 1974 was a geyser that normally jets about 150\nfeet high but can rise — to challenge all aquatic records — to more than 300\nfeet. It spews 6,000 gallons of water a minute from a 100,000-gallon hidden\nreservoir fed by an aquifer some 50 feet below ground. (This so-called\n“fourth river” is a staple of Pittsburgh trivia quizzes.) The fountain was not\nthe only way to accentuate the Point, but since the old Pittsburgh had its\ncolumns of fire and smoke, there is some appropriateness to this play of\nwaters as a symbol for the cleaner city of today.\nUntil the 1990s, Pittsburgh was the only city with structures designed by\nboth of the grand Kahns of American architecture: Albert and Louis. In the\n1930s, the industrial architect Albert Kahn put up an important component\nof the Heinz factories on the North Side, and in 1976, Louis Kahn (no rela-\ntion) designed the American Wind Symphony’s barge Point-Counterpoint II,\nwhich for several decades was docked on the Allegheny River frontage of the\nPoint. Kahn’s barge would float down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers for\nconcert tours in the summer. The floating concert hall and musicians’ dormi-\ntory was clad in burnished steel, and with its huge portholes, it looked like a\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Since 1996, the symphony has chosen to sail\nKahn’s barge in different waters; it now takes music through the heart of\nNorth America and as far away as Europe.\nGateway Center, with the earlier Gateway Plaza and later Equitable\n50\nPlaza, was more than a postwar investment by the Equitable Life Assurance\nSociety; it was a leap of faith in the future of Pittsburgh and — in a way no\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW longer imaginable — a demonstration of the healing power of modern\nPORTRAIT\narchitecture. Conceived in 1947, One, Two, and Three Gateway were among\nthe most talked-about buildings after World War II because, apart from New\nYork’s Rockefeller Center, so large a single-blueprint commercial complex\ncould be found nowhere else in the world. Also making the leap of faith were\nthe corporations that signed up as tenants: Jones & Laughlin Steel, PPG\nIndustries, People’s Gas, and Westinghouse, which made their commitments\non the basis of nothing more than a sketch.\nThe design of these cruciform towers represented a tug of war between\nthe traditionalists Otto Eggers and Daniel Higgins, both involved with John\nRussell Pope in the design of the National Gallery and the Jefferson Memorial\nin Washington, and the progressive Irwin Clavan, who in the same years\ndesigned cruciform-tower housing estates in New York. Behind Gateway\nCenter also lies the exemplar of Le Corbusier’s towers-in-the-park scheme\nfor Paris in 1922. Between seven and fifteen cruciform towers were originally\nprojected for Pittsburgh, all in traditional brick and limestone. At the last\nminute the designs were respecified for stainless steel, but scarcities because\nof the Korean War resulted in the use of chrome-alloyed steel.\nWhen building resumed in Equitable Plaza, across Liberty Avenue, from\n1955 to 1968, the landscape architects used a more informal site plan.\nHowever, the continuous perimeter podium they created makes this half of\nGateway Center more difficult to enter from the adjoining streets. The Verizon\nBuilding and the Pennsylvania State Office Building on the plaza are conven-\ntional office slabs, but the bold shape of Four Gateway, with its long glass\ntower and extruded stainless-steel service wing, is a fine expression of mid-\ncentury modernism.\nOne of the criticisms of Gateway Center (especially in Jane Jacobs’s The\nDeath and Life of Great American Cities) is the way it turned its back on the\nlarger city. Fifth Avenue Place, on the opposite side of Stanwix Street, was the\nfirst building in thirty-five years to create a visual link with the Gateway\ncomplex rather than standing back from it, as the PPG and Riverfront Center,\nat 20 Stanwix Street, complexes do.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.2 DOWNTOWN: A GOlDeN TriANGle\nOpposite Fifth Avenue Place, at the corner of Stanwix and Penn, stands\na still fondly remembered remnant of Downtown’s retail history. The struc-\nture that for a century housed the Joseph Horne Company department store\nis today Penn Avenue Place and serves not shoppers but the Highmark medi-\n51\ncal insurance group (also the main tenant in Fifth Avenue Place). The exterior\nis handsome in a conventional Beaux-Arts way, while the interior was once\nstriking in its high Tuscan Doric columns with gilded moldings — all now\nstripped away. The elaborate brass window surrounds at ground level are not\nthere just for show: Horne’s was devastated by the St. Patrick’s Day flood that\nstruck Pittsburgh in 1936. Afterward, these fittings were added so that enor-\nmous brass plates can be placed over the windows to keep the Allegheny out,\nshould it rise that high again.\nThree important buildings complete Equitable Plaza toward the\nMonongahela bank. The United Steelworkers Building is the main monu-\nment to organized labor in Pittsburgh, the city in which the Iron & Steel\nWorkers Union (predecessor of the American Federation of Labor) was\norganized in 1876. The union headquarters building, originally constructed\nfor IBM, is also a milestone in skyscraper architecture; it shattered a long-held\ndogma of skyscraper construction whereby the exterior walls generally did\nnot support any of the load. For this skyscraper, however, U.S. Steel instead\nfabricated an exterior load-bearing wall in place of a conventional “curtain”\nwall. During construction, the three different types of steel in the exterior\nwalls were painted red, white, or blue to designate their different structural\nroles. The midcentury slickness of the design can at times be cloying, but\nparticularly at night the thirteen-story diamond-faceted walls of stainless\nsteel hover alluringly over the heavy concrete base.\nThe union building faces a mildly Gothic brick-faced St. Mary of Mercy\nChurch on the opposite corner of Boulevard of the Allies and Stanwix. A\nharmless legend — possibly even true — holds that the church stands just\nwhere the first Mass in Pittsburgh was celebrated in 1754. Behind the United\nSteelworkers’ tower, overlooking the Monongahela’s bank at Stanwix Street\nat the corner of Fort Pitt Boulevard, stands the former world headquarters of\nWestinghouse Electric Corporation. The dark gray anodized aluminum slab\nfor what was then one of Pittsburgh’s corporate mainstays was less progres-\nsive in design than the same company’s research centers built in the 1950s\nand 1960s at Churchill and Monroeville. Nonetheless, Westinghouse was\ntechnically distinguished by its pioneering integration of the lighting, heating,\nand air-conditioning systems and by having the world’s first talking elevators,\ndeveloped by Westinghouse, of course.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.Riverfront Center, at the opposite corner of Stanwix Street and Fort Pitt\nBoulevard, takes a more informal approach to corporate architecture: a skewed\nhexagon wrapped in sunscreens of Italian travertine. The appearance of sun-\nscreens in Pittsburgh marked the final confirmation of the efficacy of its\n52\nstringent pollution controls: in pre-Renaissance Pittsburgh, few people wor-\nried about overexposure to the sun.\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW First Side is a finely scaled district comprising the dozen blocks along the\nPORTRAIT\nMonongahela waterfront from Stanwix to Grant streets and from Fort Pitt\nBoulevard to the Boulevard of the Allies. Its western end, between Stanwix\nand Market streets, follows John Campbell’s provisional plan of 1764. The\nlayout of First Side was shaped a second time by the Great Fire of 1845,\nwhich leveled most of it, and a third time by the enlargement of Second\nAvenue into the Boulevard of the Allies, in 1922. The resulting traffic flow cut\nFirst Side off from the rest of Downtown, which helped preserve it. Its richly\ndetailed shops and warehouses, with dramatic views of the Monongahela\nRiver and Mount Washington, are now being enhanced by 151 FirstSide, an\neighteen-story tower on the waterfront that was the first new condominium\nin the Golden Triangle since the Pittsburgh Renaissance.\nArchitecturally, the most consistent block remaining from the old Golden\nTriangle is the 100 block of Market Street between the Boulevard of the Allies\nand First Avenue. Here, except for two gaps, both sides of the street are\npacked with commercial structures that have residential lofts on the top\nfloors. The buildings are largely mid- and late nineteenth-century substitutes\nfor shops and warehouses that were lost in the fire of 1845.\nWhatever fate held in store for Pittsburgh in 1784, surveyor George\nWoods was sure it would be linked to the Monongahela, so he drew most of\nhis 490 lots as narrow strips on the numbered avenues parallel to the Monon-\ngahela. In consequence, scores of First Side’s towers have double façades that\nstretch from one avenue to another. This feature is particularly evident in the\n200 block of Fort Pitt Boulevard, between Market and Wood streets, where a\ndozen of the best old commercial buildings front on both the Monongahela\nand First Avenue. For a hundred years, until 1955, the riverbank was a single\nbroad levee, where steamboats would pick up and disgorge passengers and\nfreight. The steamboat and barge trade was so voluminous at Pittsburgh that\nfor a century the city claimed to be the world’s busiest inland port; in some\nquarters that claim persists.\nThe Conestoga Building at the corner of Fort Pitt Boulevard and Wood\nStreet got its name from the westward pioneers who bought covered wagons\nin the Conestoga Valley of Lancaster County and then brought them across the\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Though\nshorn of its elaborate cornice, the Conestoga Building survives as one of the\noldest steel-frame buildings in town.\nMost of the nearby structures on the riverfront predate the Conestoga by\n53\na generation, and several feature cast-iron fronts. Two examples of the latter\nare 235 and 239 Fort Pitt, where iron elements were bolted over traditional\nbrick and wood façades. Closer to the Point, at number 231, is an elegantly\nrestored Italianate brick and stone façade. The old four-story warehouse at\n227 Fort Pitt Boulevard now stands as a contemporary evocation of the oriel\nfronts or narrow bay windows that once overlooked many of Pittsburgh’s\nstreets a century ago.\nWood Street unfolds its architectural character block by block from the\nMonongahela to Liberty Avenue, offering excellent examples of architectural\nstyles popular after the Great Fire of 1845. One block in from the river, at the\ncorner of Wood Street and First Avenue, stand four Beaux-Arts skyscrapers\n(two with matching façades on the Boulevard of the Allies), which in their\ngravitas suggest Pittsburgh’s consciousness of being midway between Chicago\nand New York, with the power of the first tempered by the urbanity of the\nsecond. At 101–103 Wood Street there survives another of Pittsburgh’s cast-\niron fronts, this one from about 1860. Despite a lifeless retrofitting in the\n1980s, the iron-stamped Gothic façade provided some inspiration for the\ndesign of the neighboring Wood-Allies Garage on the Boulevard of the Allies.\nThat nine-level steel-deck cage begins with a red neo-Romanesque brick base\nand ends as a parody of the fake Gothic pinnacles of PPG down the block.\nAfter two blocks that are predominantly Beaux-Arts in character, Wood\nStreet switches its architectural code at the intersection with Boule vard of the\nAllies to Art Deco in the twenty-one-story main building of Point Park\nUniversity (the university uses Wood Street as the central promenade of its\nurban campus). What failed once as an athletic club and again as a hotel\ntoday succeeds as a leading center for the performing arts. With thirty-five\nhundred students, Point Park University is a major component of the Golden\nTriangle educational offerings. An estimated forty thousand students can be\nfound Downtown on weekdays, a projection that is accurate if it also encom-\npasses Duquesne University, on the edge of Downtown.\nThe blocks farther inland introduce other architectural styles: late inter-\nnational style for the YWCA at Third Avenue, and mid-Victorian for a set of\nstorefronts beyond Fourth Avenue at 409, 411, 413–415, and 417 Wood Street.\nThe second to last of these has been the home of Weldin’s stationers since\n1883; the current classically inspired façade is a redesign from 1905.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

PPG\nPITTSBURGH: Place occupies five and a half acres in a complex of eight elements that occupy\nA NEW\nPORTRAIT or touch six city blocks. The central element is the half-acre open plaza, with\na forty-story glass tower in the center and five uniformly detailed low-rise\nstructures around it. Between the tower and the Gateway Center complex\non Stanwix Street lies the three-story Wintergarden atrium, while a second\natrium below Two PPG Place is home to restaurants and specialty shops.\nEverything is sheathed in uniform mirror glass, with twenty thousand pieces\nof silver PPG Solarban in the tower alone. In winter, the outdoor plaza\nbecomes a skating rink; the rest of the year children enjoy the user-friendly\n“water feature” fountains around the central obelisk.\nThe creation of PPG Place in 1984 was an American corporation’s out-\nstanding act of generosity toward its home city. Pittsburgh Plate Glass was\nfounded half a block away in 1883 by John Pitcairn and John B. Ford. Today,\nit is the largest producer of glass in the world, as well as a giant in paints, plas-\ntics, and chemicals. When the company considered building a headquarters\ntower near its birthplace on Market Street, it knew that it would be relatively\neasy to buy only the half acre it needed. But what PPG really wanted was to\nupgrade the whole district in the manner of Rockefeller Center, so it pur-\nchased an area ten times larger than needed for its own building. It was a\ndaring move, considering the financial and political risks involved. Another\ndaring move was the selection of Philip Johnson’s unconventional Post-\nmodern Gothic design for the PPG office tower. It marked only the second\ntime in the postwar era (after Johnson’s design for the AT&T headquarters in\nNew York) that an American corporation had chosen fantasy over the staid\nInternational School Style for its public image.\nThe obvious precedent of the PPG design is the Victoria Tower at the\nHouses of Parliament in London, though it is only about half the height of\nPPG’s 635 feet. There was also a local model: the Cathedral of Learning at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh. PPG’s tower is a brilliant apparition when seen from\noutside the Triangle, for example, from West Park on the North Side. Unlike\nthe Cathedral of Learning, which has a rich variety of surface and texture, the\nPPG tower tends to the monotonous at close range. The interior, with its\nsoaring lobby and repetitive arches, is visually unyielding, although hand-\nsome with its deep-red glass paneling. Despite these blemishes, PPG Place\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.fig. 2.8\nPPG Place\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

The two-block stretch of Fourth Avenue from PPG Place\nPORTRAIT\nup to Smithfield Street, intersected by Wood Street, was once home to the\ndozen banks that stored this capital. Pittsburgh still has high importance as a\nfinancial center, but the oil and stock exchanges and most of the banks that\nmade Fourth Avenue an erstwhile rival to Wall Street were torn down years\nago. The most distinguished of these vanished structures was Frank Furness’s\nquirky but lovable Farmers’ Deposit National Bank as well as the Bank of\nPittsburgh, the latter a close approximation of the New York Stock Exchange.\nConstructed in 1896, the Bank of Pittsburgh came down in the 1940s, although\nits columns survive in Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in suburban Pleasant Hills.\nAs the oldest commercial building and the only externally intact Greek\nRevival structure in Downtown today, the Burke Building at 209 Fourth\nAvenue has seen it all. Built in 1836, and for a time serving as a bank, it stood\nfor a decade before the Great Fire skirted it by a few feet in 1845. The build-\ning’s owners were the Irish-born lawyers Robert and Andrew Burke; their\narchitect, John Chislett, was born in England in 1800 and schooled himself in\nthe Neoclassical traditions seen in the buildings of Bath. Chislett came to\nPittsburgh around 1833 and was the city’s dominant architect during the\nmid-nineteenth century. The Burke Building today resembles a domestic more\nthan a commercial design: a brick structure faced in sandstone, Doric col-\numns at the door, and a four-square plan with fireplaces and a central stair\nhall. With windows elongated almost to doors in the manner popularized by\nThomas Jefferson, it is uncompromisingly elegant.\nThe trio of the Benedum-Trees, Investment, and Arrott buildings on\nFourth Avenue just below Wood might recall the fortified towers of medieval\nBologna or San Gimignano. The rhythm for the group was set by the\nArrott, at the corner of Fourth and Wood. Its designer, Frederick Osterling\n(1865–1934), was both prolific and quarrelsome, but he was a generally\nbrilliant designer in Pittsburgh for nearly half a century. His range of styles\nincluded Romanesque, Classical Revival, and modern Gothic. Osterling’s\ndesign for an insurance magnate demonstrates the usual academic sequence\nof a large-scale base intended for retail purposes, then a shaft of office floors\nin rusticated brick patterning, and a cap of four stories with tall arched\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

The lobby is an equally impressive\nmix of marble, mosaic, and brass.\nThree years after Osterling designed the Arrott, the Machesney tower\nrose at 221 Fourth Avenue; it was later renamed the Benedum-Trees Building\n59\nafter the oilmen Michael Benedum and Joseph Trees bought it. At nineteen\nstories, Benedum-Trees was only slightly lower than the Arrott, and it clearly\nresponded both to the Arrott and to the now-vanished Bank of Pittsburgh in\nits dramatic base of Corinthian columns and oriel windows, an aggressively\nvertical terra-cotta shaft, and an enormous overhanging entablature complete\nwith lions and florid curved brackets. The Investment Building at 239 Fourth\nAvenue went up in the 1920s, making it a generation younger than the towers\nleft and right of it. Its brick shaft is a total abstraction without ornament,\nbut at the top the corners are sliced away to reveal a set of elegant obelisks,\npowerful enough to catch the eye of Philip Johnson when he designed his\nNeo classical obelisk for PPG Place down the block.\nPoint Park University Center is an adaptive reuse of a group of six banks\nthat once clustered together in the 400 block of Wood and up Fourth and\nForbes avenues. The first two banks were the Freehold Building and the Real\nEstate Trust Company on Fourth Avenue, both from the 1890s. These were\njoined at the corner of Fourth and Wood in 1901 by the People’s Savings\nBank, a fifteen-story tower that mirrors the Arrott tower across Wood Street.\nIt might be called competent rather than remarkable except for the brilliantly\nhandled semi-circular stairwell inside and the raised brick panels that are\nrandomly scattered on the exterior, giving the building the appearance of a\ndecaying Roman ruin. The bank’s most delicious feature is its two dramatic\nreliefs of industrious bees, easily inspected from the sidewalk.\nIn 1902, the Colonial Trust Company cut sideways through the block to\ncreate a fourth building, with twin Renaissance-style façades on Fourth and\nForbes avenues; what was supposedly the world’s longest bank lobby ran in\nbetween. In 1926, the dual façades became a trio when the lobby was extended\nas a T-shape and fronted with a severe Ionic pediment at 414 Wood. The sixth\nand last piece of the puzzle fell into place the next year, when a new building\nlinked the Wood Street façades of the People’s Bank tower to the Colonial\nTrust. In 1976, prominent Argentina-born designer Rodolfo Machado, who\nwas working for the IKM Partnership and taught at Carnegie Mellon, came\nup with a cool, minimalist design for a shopping mall project that would amal-\ngamate these buildings. The design scheme was widely praised but under-\nfunded, and an inexpensive alternative design was used instead. When that\nmall went bankrupt, the complex underwent a final renovation in 1997 and\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

What sounds like a depressing\nchronicle has ended on an uplifting note: the interior columns and the lilting\nvolumes of the interior are just short of breath taking. A grand staircase on the\nright enables viewers to inspect the magnificent gold-paneled ceiling.\n61\nFourth Avenue is marked by a particularly pleasing visual consistency\ntoday. Because of that quality, twenty-four of its buildings were incorporated\ninto a National Register of Historic Places district in 1985. The south side of\nthe 300 block of Fourth, from Wood to Smithfield streets, originally had a\nsequence of four banks and a newspaper office. The three turn-of-the-c entury\nbanks at 306, 312, and 324 Fourth were the Union National Bank, the\nCommonwealth Trust, and Keystone Bank — all predictably sober except for\nthe beautifully articulated Keystone Bank, where a light court was recessed in\nthe façade and garlanded above by a bridgelike arch. The three towers were\neventually amalgamated into the Union National Bank, whose core structure\nwas converted into the Carlyle, a luxury condominium residence, in 2007.\nThe first fourteen floors of standard units and four top floors of double-sized\napartments sold at such a satisfying rate that the developers purchased the\nCommonwealth Building for conversion into an additional sixty residences.\nThe upper end of the same Fourth Avenue block is considerably less\nsober. The evolving social and business attitudes in mid- and late nineteenth-\ncentury America can be discerned by comparing the efflorescence of the\nearlier Dollar Bank, at the upper corner intersecting Smithfield Street, to the\nstraitlaced Union National, at the lower corner intersecting Wood. Dollar\nBank, dating from 1871, with wings added in 1906, is the ultimate in public\nrelations architecture; it is a building that is all doorway. The red sandstone\nfaçade features a sumptuous pair of double columns guarding the door with\nthe help of two dozing lions. Its designer, Isaac Hobbs, was a fashionable\nPhiladelphia architect and architectural publisher whose conception of the bank\nshows at once what was both splendid and hopeless in Victorian architecture.\nThe ornament is vigorous, learned, and delightful, but the essential lines of\nthe façade are drowned by the Baroque and Italianate details.\nThe imbalance of the part and the whole, so characteristic of American\narchitecture after the Civil War, was the problem that would occupy H. H.\nRichardson, who was just beginning his architectural career when Dollar\nBank went up. Frederick Osterling, Richardson’s long-distance pupil (there\nis no indication the two designers ever met), captured the simplifying ability\nof his “master” reasonably well in the four-story Times Building alongside\nDollar Bank, at 336 Fourth Avenue. The patron here was the publisher, civic\npowerhouse, and GOP political boss Christopher Lyman Magee, for his\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Now sensitively restored inside, this eight-\nstory Romanesque Revival tower has façades on both Fourth and Third\navenues, with the former enlivened by particularly fine grotesque carvings that\nare replicated in the dimly lit interior of the building.\n62\nWhat was once a solid line of buildings on the north side of the 300 block\nof Fourth Avenue is now broken by a parking lot, but even so, this view shows\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW how good architects can make their structures distinctive without destroying the\nPORTRAIT\nwider unity of a city block. The flagship of this upper block is the Standard Life\nBuilding at 345 Fourth Avenue, dressed in deep red Roman bricks and terra-\ncotta plaques. The Standard Life skyscraper “talks” to People’s Savings at the\nlower end of the block with its exaggerated detail on the upper floors, particu-\nlarly the colossal arch stones set over the top windows. To the left of Standard\nLife is the earliest building of this cluster, the Fidelity Trust Building from 1889,\nat 341 Fourth. It begins well with a base of two massive arched doors and a\ndwarf mezzanine of three rectangular openings with colonettes, but in the\nupper floors the façade changes rhythm at almost every level, as though slices\nof a half dozen different buildings had been stacked atop one another.\nIn 1898, a decade after the construction of the Fidelity Trust Building,\nHenry Clay Frick summoned the dean of American architects, Daniel Burnham,\nto build the small Union Trust Company (now the Engineers’ Society) at 337\nFourth, immediately next door. This little Greek temple, with a podium of\ndeeply channeled blocks below and severe Doric columns above, was the first\nof eleven projects that Burnham drew up for Pittsburgh — more than he\ncreated for any city except his native Chicago. Next door to Burnham’s monu-\nment, local architect Charles M. Bartberger built a considerably more accom-\nplished structure for his Industrial Bank, at 333 Fourth Avenue. Bartberger\nwas the German-trained son of the prolific German-born Charles F. Bartberger,\nwho in terms of volume was one of Pittsburgh’s top architects from the 1850s\nto the 1880s. Charles M. in turn trained his own son, Edward W. Bartberger,\nwho lived until 1968. Thus, three Bartberger generations practiced architec-\nture in Pittsburgh for well over a century.\nCharles M. Bartberger appears to have thought carefully about eighteenth-\ncentury Neoclassical precedents before crafting a Beaux-Arts synthesis for the\nIndustrial Bank. The architectural languages of the Englishman Nicholas\nHawksmoor, the Frenchman Claude-Nicholas Ledoux, and the German\nPeter Speeth seem to predominate. For dramatic effect, Bartberger capri-\nciously overscaled elements like the triglyphs, some of which suddenly and\nirrationally droop down onto the masonry surface. Every element of the façade\n“speaks” as well as looks the part it was meant to play: the public banking hall\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Finally, Bartberger was subtle and\namusing in his contextual references. The single perky acroterion (stylized\nplant leaf) on his pediment mimics the five that Burnham used with dour\n63\nseriousness next door, while the combination of arch below and dwarf mezza-\nnine above is a tribute to the same feature in the Fidelity Trust, two doors\naway. The Industrial Bank design was Bartberger’s finest hour. Perhaps he\nknew it; at any rate, when the opportunity came, he seized it.\nsmiThfielD sTreeT AND DOWNTOWN reTAil\nT\nhe name Smithfield Street constitutes a tribute to the little- remembered\nRevolutionary War captain Devereux Smith (1735–1799), who was a\npersonal friend of George Washington and operated a successful\nIndian trading firm with Ephriam Douglass. Smithfield began as an ordinary\ncross-street like Wood, but when a bridge connected it to the South Side in\n1818 it became richer and larger in scale, and its small, early buildings were\ncannibalized by bigger ones. There are, nonetheless, some worthy survivors.\nOne is the elegant Adam-style Americus Club (now the Pitt Building) at the\ncorner of Allies and Smithfield. Built in 1918 in the English Neoclassical\nStyle of the late eighteenth century, the clubhouse’s left side was amputated\nfour years later when the narrow old Second Avenue was transformed into\nthe Boulevard of the Allies. Two other lively survivors stand at 110 and 112\nSmithfield. The first is a High Victorian Gothic commercial block, dated 1881,\nwhich presents itself with all the pugnacity of a piece of Eastlake furniture. It\nis a marvelous sight in the sparkle of its blue, red, and light brown tiles. The\nsecond standout is the L-shaped former home of Engine Company No. 2, a\nformer firehouse from 1900 that introduces an Art Nouveau flavor to the\nneigh bor hood. It stands three stories tall, with a bleached white granite base\nand two stories of beautifully dressed sandstone.\nThe intersection of Smithfield Street and Fifth Avenue is the busiest in\ntown and is among the most significant for its architecture. The prime build-\nfig. 2.15\ning here is Macy’s Department Store (Kaufmann’s until 2006), while on the\nKaufmann’s clock\nthree other corners stand the old Mellon Bank headquarters, the early high-\nfig. 2.16\nrise Park Building, and the Swindall-Rust headquarters, formerly the Frank\nMacy’s, formerly\n& Seder Department Store, which provides a Classical counterweight to some Kaufmann’s\nof its more architecturally unruly neighbors. The elaborate clock at the Macy’s\ncorner proclaims the importance of the store: at close to a million square feet,\nits significance is not merely architectural but social and even cultural.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.The Macy’s store offers a prime recollection of three figures tightly\nwoven into the fabric of Pittsburgh: Edgar Kaufmann Sr., Benno Janssen,\nand Frank Lloyd Wright. Brothers Morris, Henry, Jacob, and Isaac Kaufmann\narrived in Pittsburgh from Germany in the years after 1860, and by 1871,\n64\nthey had a flourishing trade on the South Side. Around 1877, the Kaufmanns\nmoved their store to this prestigious corner, and in 1885, the year Morris’s\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW son Edgar was born, they enlarged it into the “Big Store.” The corner of the\nPORTRAIT\nstore now standing at Smithfield and Forbes was built for the Kaufmanns\nin 1898 by Charles Bickel and borrows motifs from the Romanesque and\nClassical Revivals, as well as from the Chicago school of Louis Henry Sullivan\nand his colleagues.\nEdgar Kaufmann Sr. (1885–1955), universally known as E. J., took charge\nof the firm in 1913 and had the socially prominent architect Benno Janssen\ndesign a new terra-cotta block to replace the store built in 1885 at the corner\nof Smithfield and Fifth. A few years later Kaufmann purchased the first of\nfifteen hundred acres for a country retreat near Pittsburgh that Frank Lloyd\nWright made world famous as Fallingwater. Janssen designed an extension\nof the store on Forbes Avenue at Cherry Way a few years later. In 1930, he\nmodernized its ground floor interior in Art Deco Style, with piers of black\nCarrara glass and murals by Boardman Robinson. Critics regarded it as\nthe most beautiful store in America — and the most profitable. It marked\nKaufmann’s first step toward Modernism.\nThe glass and murals are long gone from Kaufmann’s/Macy’s, and so is\nthe office that Wright built for Kaufmann in 1936 and 1937 (contemporary\nwith Fallingwater) on the store’s tenth floor. Wright designed the furniture\nand paneling for this sumptuous suite, including a cypress plywood mural,\nand he selected the wall fabrics himself. The office served Kaufmann for\ntwenty years, until his death in 1955, after which his son Edgar Jr. had it\ndismantled and shipped to London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, where\nit is a star attraction.\nArchitect Benno Janssen (1874–1964) is undeservedly forgotten today,\neven though a recent biography offers excellent coverage of his body of work.\nJanssen was born to a German-American family in St. Louis, enrolled at the\nÉcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1902, and soon after came to work in\nPittsburgh. He was the best academic designer Pittsburgh ever had, on a par\nwith or superior to Carrère & Hastings, Horace Trumbauer, David Adler,\nCharles Platt, and the host of others who took care of wealthy Americans’\narchitectural needs before and after World War I. Kaufmann was Janssen’s\nmost loyal client. He gave him nearly a dozen commissions and even lived in\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Kaufmann commis-\n65\nsioned buildings from Janssen, Wright, the Bauhaus-associated Richard Neutra\n(for Kaufmann’s Palm Springs winter retreat, the out standing example of\nAmerican midcentury modernism), Joseph Urban (a swimming pool at the\nIrene Kaufmann Settlement on the Hill), and the important Pittsburgh archi-\ntects Mitchell & Ritchey (for the Civic Arena in the lower Hill District). After\nJanssen retired in the 1930s, Kaufmann switched his architectural allegiance\nto Wright, and together the two men planned Fallingwater in 1934 and 1935.\nKaufmann’s architectural patronage reminds us in turn of how impor-\ntant Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) was to Pittsburgh and vice versa.\nKaufmann was Wright’s outstanding patron. Their partnership lasted twenty\nyears and yielded nearly a dozen uncompleted projects in addition to those\nthat were realized. The unfinished projects included Kaufmann’s sponsor-\nship of Wright’s Broadacre City model, which was exhibited at Kaufmann’s\nimmediately after being shown in 1935 at Rockefeller Center; Wright’s exten-\nsive sketches for a megastructure at the Point; the Rhododendron Chapel,\nmeant to rise on the grounds of Fallingwater; another winter house (Wright\nintended it to outshine the one already built by Neutra); a hillside apartment\non Mount Washington; and a planetarium and parking garage next to\nKaufmann’s store. Though disappointingly little came of it, the partnership\nof Wright and Kaufmann was one of the most intense collaborations of artist\nand patron in the history of American art.\nAN ArchiTecTurAl pArADe ON fifTh AveNue\nf\nifth Avenue was for years Downtown’s primary retail and entertain-\nment corridor, but the free parking offered by the suburban shopping\nmalls and theaters forced the street into decay. The throngs seen in old\nphotographs of Fifth Avenue will never return, but in the meantime, there is\nheartening progress, with several excellent buildings waiting to be reutilized.\nThe Park Building, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield, is a design\ntriumph by the then-dean of American architects, George B. Post. Completed\nin 1896, it was the third or fourth of Pittsburgh’s steel-frame skyscrapers.\nPost’s local patrons were David and William Park, operators of the Black\nDiamond Steel Works and major investors in Pittsburgh real estate. The site\nwas appropriate; the Pittsburgh Iron Foundry went up at this intersection in\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

But the joy of the Park Building is\nPORTRAIT\nin the thirty telemones or Atlases that are (seemingly) crushed by the weight of\nthe top cornice. The telemones are cast in terra cotta and were originally poly-\nchromed. Pittsburgh has always loved them, perhaps because these mytho-\nlogical creatures straining at their work symbolize the hard physical labor that\nfor so long characterized the city’s work force.\nThe 300 block of Fifth Avenue, from Smithfield down to Wood Street,\nwas for a century home to another of Pittsburgh’s innovative skyscrapers. At\n335 Fifth Avenue master piano salesman Samuel Hamilton erected the ten-\nstory Hamilton Building in 1889 to a height of 125 feet. The building was a\ntraditional masonry structure, not steel frame, but it was the last word in late\nVictorian commercial expression. A few doors down from where the “piano”\nskyscraper once stood is the structure that ate it up: Piatt Place, at the corner\nof Fifth Avenue and Wood Street. This was originally the Lazarus Department\nStore. When it went up in 1998, it was the first new American downtown\ndepartment store in decades, though it failed almost immediately. The adap-\ntive reuse given the structure in 2007 yielded another sixty-five luxury\ncondo miniums to house a growing Downtown population. The rest of the\ncomplex features street-level boutiques and restaurants.\nfig. 2.17\nPark Building\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

On\nthe street’s south side are arrayed a number of hearty survivors from the early\nretail days. The double-unit commercial structure at 214–218 Fifth Avenue is\n67\nan Italianate cast-iron front from the 1860s or 1870s, with large glass panes\nand interlacing floral designs stamped out in iron molds. Farther down the\nstreet stand two particularly good examples of retail and office blocks from\nthe early twentieth century: the Buhl Building at 205 Fifth Avenue from 1913,\ndecked out in ebullient blue and cream terra-cotta plaques, and the Diamond\nBuilding (formerly the Diamond National Bank), from 1904, at the inter-\nsection of Fifth Avenue and Liberty. The latter rises twelve stories high and\nis topped by the most dramatic Beaux-Arts copper cornice in the city. The\nhandsome block bends backward from its central entrance to fit into one of\nthe triangular lots embodied in the quirky city plan of 1784.\nOliver plAzA AND pNc plAzA\nT\nhe closing of the tail end of Oliver Avenue between Wood and Liberty\nin the 1960s created a trapezoid block on which now rise four tall\ntowers. The earliest of these was One Oliver Plaza, a thirty-eight-story\nglass-and-steel box standing on a base of dark granite at the Sixth Avenue\nangle of the trapezoid. At the Fifth Avenue end of the block stands One PNC\nPlaza, built as the Pittsburgh National Bank Building in 1972. This replaced\nan Italian Renaissance tower that Daniel Burnham erected for the predeces-\nsor First National Bank. One PNC Plaza was conceived as a glass slab, with a\nservice core that is clad in pearl-gray granite. It does its job well, but at thirty\nstories, the current building is merely three floors higher than the 1912 tower\nit replaced, leading one to question the notion of architectural obsolescence.\nTwo PNC Plaza was squeezed between the One Oliver and One PNC\nPlaza towers in 1976. Although handicapped by weak linkage to the streets in\nfront and behind them, the two interlocking mirror-glass octagons of Two\nPNC manage an elegant solution to an overbuilt site. The octagonal geometry\nof these twin towers relates well to the polygonal shape of the former Meyer\nand Jonasson department store, the low-rise neighbor at 606 Liberty Avenue.\nMeyer and Jonasson got its odd shape because it conformed to the old course\nof Oliver Avenue before it was filled in below Wood Street.\nThe technologically advanced Three PNC Plaza was Downtown’s first\nhigh-rise in a generation. Its environmentally friendly materials and energy-\nefficient cooling and heating systems won it a LEED (Leadership in Energy\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Construction of the tower is one more indica-\n69\ntion of the modest resurgence of Pittsburgh’s business community.\nmArkeT squAre\nT\nhe history of Pittsburgh is written out in buildings in every part of the\nGolden Triangle, as seen in First Side and in the palatial skyscrapers\non Fourth Avenue that still speak of Pittsburgh’s wealth in the early\ntwentieth century. Visitors nonetheless get their best feel for old Pittsburgh in\nand around Market Square. Much of the square’s pedestrian traffic comes\nfrom its utility as a walkway between PNC Plaza, a block to the north, and\nPPG Place, a block to the south. But even in its current weakened state — we\ncan always hope for a better one — Market Square can still claim to be the heart\nof Downtown.\nThe square was the sole open space in George Woods’s 1784 street plan.\nfig. 2.19\nOver the years it was the site of a courthouse, a city hall, and a sequence of\nMarket Square\nmarket buildings that came down only in 1961. Historically the square (west-\nern Pennsylvanians traditionally call a space like this a diamond) was always\nmeant to be paved and built on, not green and open as the present pseudo-\nrestoration has it. A better alternative would be to get rid of the quadrants,\ncover the central square with glass over a gigantic neon map of Pittsburgh,\nand invite citizens to dance there every night.\nThe diamond’s perimeter buildings pretty much summarize Pittsburgh’s\narchitectural history: Gallagher’s Pub and Ryan’s Ale House (2 and 3 Market\nPlace) from the Civil War era, a fragment of glassy PPG Place at the south-\nwest quadrant, and a restaurant decked out in Tudor Revival. Two of the\nbetter citizens of the square are Nicholas Coffee and the Landmark Tavern,\nwhich dates to 1902. The former displays a tall Chippendale front crowned\nby a neon coffee cup with steam wafting out; this joking reference to Philip\nJohnson’s Chippendale-topped Sony Building in New York serves also as an\nefficient device to give height to the façade and elegance to an urban gathering\nplace that sorely needs it.\nThe best recent news for Market Square is the Downtown YMCA (along\nwith apartments overhead) taking over the shuttered G. C. Murphy store where\nMarket Square fronts on Forbes Avenue (the rebuilt complex goes by the\nredundant name of Market Square Place).

The Mellons had been a presence in Down-\ntown since Judge Thomas Mellon resigned from the bench in 1869 and\nopened a bank, saying that any man who could not get rich in Pittsburgh\nwithin ten years was a fool. Mellon’s first bank was a masonry building at 514\nSmithfield Street, roughly opposite what is now the square, but in 1873, the\njudge put up a more imposing cast-iron front that featured a statue of his\nhero, Benjamin Franklin.\nSerene and majestic on the outside, Mellon Bank has covered the block\nof Smithfield between Fifth Avenue and Mellon Square since 1924, but it has\nbeen destroyed inside. The long and airy banking hall, one of Pittsburgh’s\nprime architectural and social spaces, vanished in 1999 when its short-sighted\nowners and an overeager city hall let Lord and Taylor rebuild it as a faux-\nManhattan emporium. Fifteen tons of Italian marble in each of the Ionic\ncolumns was smashed and hauled away, leaving just their steel cores. Gone\nwas the vast basilicalike space of the hall, sixty-five feet tall and two hundred\nfeet long; gone were the aisles coffered and painted deep blue with speckles\nof gold leaf; gone was any hint that the world’s earliest venture capitalists once\noperated out of Pittsburgh. Befitting its place as the heart of Mellon opera-\ntions, the hall commemorated A. W. and R. B. Mellon with portraits and\ninscriptions on the walls of the vault. After Lord and Taylor’s quick demise a\nfew years later, the now banal interior awaits some new use.\nBanking was always just the visible tip of the Mellon money machine.\nTheir investments in coal, coke, steel and its chemical by-products, oil, alumi-\nnum, real estate, and transportation were far more lucrative than what they\nearned as bankers. Until the appearance of megabillionaires in computers\nand securities in the 1980s and 1990s, the Mellons of Pittsburgh were among\nthe wealthiest families in the world, in a league with the Fords, the Rockefellers,\nand the du Ponts.\nThe family headquartered its business ventures on Smithfield Street\nuntil three of those firms required their own headquarters. At the end of the\n1920s, Gulf and Koppers moved two blocks away, to Seventh Avenue. Alcoa\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

He quashed the move to New York, and he and his\nmore worldly cousin Paul Mellon conceived a grand complex that would\n71\nhouse Alcoa and the expanded bank operations in twin towers facing each\nother across a park. Construction of Mellon Square and its underground\nparking garage required demolition of a full city block, but it paid off hand-\nsomely in sight lines to all the surrounding buildings. Apart from creating a\nplace in which its perimeter buildings might preen, Mellon Square holds up\nwell as a period piece from the mid-1950s, when “organic” and “modern”\nwere words architects could still use without stumbling. The design in Venetian\nterrazzo appears today somewhat thin in the manner of the Eisenhower years,\nbut the trees and fountains have aged well, and Kenneth Snelson’s Forest Devil\nsculpture in stainless-steel pipes provides welcome animation.\nAround Mellon Square rises a particularly impressive grouping of\ntwentieth-century skyscrapers. On the Oliver Avenue or southern edge of the\nsquare rise the Mellon Bank of the 1920s, described above, and Citizens\n(originally Mellon) Bank, a postwar financial tower on the upper edge of the\nsquare. On the square’s western edge stands the Oliver Building, from 1910,\nand at its northwest corner the Heinz 57 Center, headquarters for Heinz\nNorth America. The structure was for decades a Gimbel’s department store,\nand before that Kaufmann & Baer’s, originally built by some breakaway\nKaufmann cousins to rival the main Kaufmann store. At the corresponding\nnortheast corner stands what was for years the Philadelphia Traction Company\nblock, put up in 1902 by the transportation mogul P. A. B. Widener.\nAll of these perimeter buildings carry architectural distinction, but the\nmost successful and renowned of them is the Regional Enterprise Tower,\nerected in 1953 as the Alcoa Building (the corporation handed it over in 1998\nto a consortium of nonprofit organizations). Using aluminum wherever pos-\nsible, Alcoa’s thirty-story tower is radically lighter and more efficient than\nbuildings of comparable size. Its curtain wall was not constructed piece by\npiece but prefabricated in aluminum sheets that contained both windows and\nthe floor zone. The windows swing open in special rubber gaskets, so the\nbuilding’s exterior requires minimal cleaning and maintenance. Inside, the\nsame spirit of radical innovation prevailed: aluminum furniture, aluminum\npiping and wiring, aluminum air-conditioning ducts, and an airy and fanciful\nlobby. This list of distinctions briefly propelled Alcoa to top rank among post-\nwar skyscrapers, but it was evidently too futuristic for the national design\ncommunity, which shunned it for thirty years until Richard Meier returned\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Even locally, later building designs ignored Alcoa’s precedent, except\nfor the Porter Building. Half a block uphill on Grant Street, it looks (as the\ncliché goes), like the box Alcoa was shipped in.\n73\nNOrTh Of mellON squAre\nT\nhe four blocks north of Mellon Square, marked by several narrow\neighteenth-century streets, encompass an eclectic mix of architectural\nsurvivors. The most gracious of these is the Allegheny H-Y-P Club\n(formerly the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Club) on William Penn Place at the\ncorner of Strawberry Way. It occupies one of the two plain brick rectangles\nthat were built in 1894 as worker housing, then remodeled in High-style\nGeorgian in 1930 by the academic classicist Edward B. Lee. The H-Y-P Club\nuses only the right block for its clubhouse; the left block houses nonprofit\norganizations linked to the adjoining Regional Enterprise Tower.\nThe end wall of the tiny court that separates the two blocks incorporates\nrelics from schools back East: two columns salvaged from Appleton Chapel\nat Harvard and six stones of uncertain provenance from Princeton and Yale.\nOverhead is the fantastic sight of the rose window and aluminum spire of\nSmithfield United Church. Until women were admitted to the club in 1980,\nonly two female guests had been officially entertained there. The actress\nCornelia Otis Skinner was one, Mae West the other. West remarked on the\noccasion, “It’s rather difficult for me to think up things to say to Harvard-\nYale-Princeton men collectively. Of course, I can think of plenty to say to men\nindividually.”\nNeighboring the club and a little downhill from it, at the corner of 620\nSmithfield Street and Strawberry Way, stands Smithfield United Church of\nChrist, the sixth home of a congregation founded in 1782. This highly suc-\ncess ful example of a modern inner-city church stands only a few hundred\nfeet from the original site granted it by the Penns in 1787. Smithfield United\nis one of three Downtown works — another two dozen are in Oakland — by\nPittsburgh’s outstanding local architect, Henry Hornbostel (1867–1961).\nA New Yorker who came to Pittsburgh in 1904 to build the campus of the\nCarnegie Technical Schools, predecessor to Carnegie Mellon, Hornbostel\nstayed thirty years as a designer and sometimes dean of the Carnegie Tech\nSchool of Applied Design. Hornbostel had excellent credentials: he graduated\nfrom Columbia University in 1891, spent four years at the École des Beaux-\nArts (where he was known as l’homme perspectif for his brilliant drawings),\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

The Hell Gate, Queensboro, and\n74\nManhattan bridges are his most prominent monuments there, but he also\ncreated a campus for Emory University in Atlanta and did civic buildings in\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW Albany, New York, and on the West Coast.\nPORTRAIT\nThe contrast of spiritual and mundane values is the key to understand-\ning Hornbostel’s approach to the design of the Smithfield Church. He placed\nthe church hard against the sidewalk to integrate it uncompromisingly with\nthe city and used standard industrial materials to erect it: steel, limestone, and\npoured and cast concrete. The main floor, right off the street, is not a sanctu-\nary but a gym, complete with showers and locker rooms. The congregation\nhas used it for various purposes over the years, including a daycare center\nand a dormitory for the homeless. The sanctuary, one floor up, is rich in its\nwood trim, stained glass, and lavish plaster fan vaults. Higher still, on the roof,\nHornbostel used aluminum for his filigree spire — an early use of that mate-\nrial for structural purposes and an unforgettable vision that parallels the\ncontemporary Watts Tower in Los Angeles.\nA newcomer to Smithfield Street, at number 612, is the Downtown\nbranch of Carnegie Library, a facility that gives new life to a neglected block.\nThis small but always crowded library speaks volumes, with “Library” in\noversized letters that span the entire height and width of the glass façade.\nWhat animates this end of Smithfield Street even better is a droll mural,\npainted in 2006 by Sarah Zeffiro and Tom Mosser, at the intersection of\nSmithfield and the narrow Strawberry Way, above the Wiener World hot-dog\nshop. The Two Andys presents civic heroes Andy Warhol and Andy Carnegie\nunder hair dryers, in the most striking of the two dozen murals put up around\nPittsburgh in recent years by the Sprout Fund.\nThe sixTh-Oliver cOrriDOr\nT\nhree corridors have left their imprint on the Golden Triangle: the nine\nblocks of the Cultural District, along Penn and Liberty avenues; the\ncollection of government and corporate entities along Grant Street;\nand the three-block stretch of Sixth and Oliver avenues that connects the\nMellon and PNC banking powerhouses. This last corridor is august: it pre-\nserves memories of the Mellons and the Olivers, the Duquesne Club, two\nof Pittsburgh’s oldest churches, a Brooks Brothers, and a Saks Fifth Avenue.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

The French, knowing that American Indians had used\nit, took the hillock over for their own burials from 1754 to 1758, the years in\nwhich they held Fort Duquesne at the Point. The British and Americans\nadded more graves, and by the time of the last burial in 1854, about four\nthousand recorded bodies and far more unrecorded ones rested there. The\ngraveyard left its mark on the toponomy of Pittsburgh, too. The French called\nthe processional way leading to the cemetery the Allée de la Vièrge, for the\nBlessed Virgin Mary, but the name “Virgin Alley” caused sufficient embar-\nrassment that it was changed in 1904 to Oliver Avenue.\nHenry W. Oliver (1840–1904) was one of the Scots-Irish capitalists who\nled Pittsburgh to dominance in the age of industry. His initial firm, founded\nin 1863, manufactured nuts and bolts. He reincorporated that firm in 1888\nas the Oliver Iron & Steel Company, and he eventually controlled much of\nthe rich Mesabi iron ore range in northern Minnesota. Oliver reaped millions\nfrom J. P. Morgan’s buyout of Carnegie Steel in 1901, and he proceeded to\nfig. 2.22\ninvest it Downtown. Before he died in 1904, he commissioned Daniel Burnham\nTrinity Cathedral\nto build a department store at the lower end of this block. A few years later, and graveyard\nOliver’s heirs commissioned the Oliver Building from Burnham as a memo-\nrial to the industrialist. Burnham produced a wider, deeper, taller version of his\nbuilding for H. C. Frick of a few years earlier. Its base of grayish pink granite\nDoric columns is well if coldly handled, while the main façade above is a mass\nof cream terra cotta covering a full acre and a half on the Smithfield Street\nfaçade alone. The cap to the building consists of three stories of banded\nCorinthian pilasters and an exuberant cornice line 347 feet in the air.\nThe interior decoration of the Oliver Building is carried out with similar\nélan: white marble with dark splashes of bronzework in the lobby and\nHonduras mahogany trim in the offices upstairs. The heirs were satisfied\nenough to ask Burnham for still more buildings, including a memorial bath-\nhouse next to the Oliver ironworks on the South Side (still standing, but in\nthe end designed by another firm). These properties were later capitalized\ninto the realty holding company that built Oliver Plaza (now absorbed into\nPNC Plaza) sixty years later.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.When the Penn heirs carved up the town in 1784, the sacredness attached\nto the burial ground on Sixth Avenue made it the obvious choice for the three\nfree lots they doled out to the Episcopal, Presbyterian, and German-Evangelist\ncongregations. The Presbyterians and Episcopalians are still on the block; the\n76\nGerman and Evangelist congregations are only a few hundred feet away.\nSixth Avenue’s Trinity Episcopal Cathedral and First Presbyterian Church\nPITTSBURGH:\nA NEW are both monuments with impeccable design pedigrees. Trinity’s first and\nPORTRAIT\nsecond churches of 1787 and 1805 were farther down the block, on Liberty\nAvenue; the third church was built on this site in 1824 by the rector, John\nHenry Hopkins, who published an engraving of his design locally in 1826,\nthen nationally in his Essay on Gothic Architecture in 1836. The present Trinity\nCathedral was designed forty years later by Gordon Lloyd, an English-born\narchitect from Detroit who had been trained both in the archaeological and\nrhetorical variants of the Gothic Revival. The latter taste manifests itself in the\nbold massing of the octagonal spire over the Trinity tower. Inside, the feeling\nis not English but decidedly American, and the interior assimilates several\nfeatures of the late style of Richard Upjohn, to whom the church has occa-\nsionally been attributed. Trinity is a ravishingly austere building inside, with\ncompound piers and archivolts of gray stone standing out against the cream\nwhite walls, and deep brown diaphragm arches soar across the nave. If Gordon\nLloyd was this good (not even his obituary suggested he was), all honor to him!\nFirst Presbyterian Church, on the opposite side of Trinity’s graveyard, is\nthe successor church to one that was redesigned and expanded by Benjamin\nHenry Latrobe in 1812 and to a later Gothic Revival design by Charles F.\nBartberger at midcentury. The designer of the present building, Theophilus\nP. Chandler Jr., was a practiced Philadelphia architect with excellent social\nconnections both in that city and in Boston. In Pittsburgh he was the favored\narchitect of the Thaw family, which resulted in commissions to erect three\nPresbyterian churches. The challenge to Chandler in 1905 was that the church\nmust look good against the backdrop of Trinity while upholding Presby-\nterianism in the most intensely Presbyterian city in the country. His response\nwas a much more showy design than Trinity’s, with double towers in front\nand a fantastic march of gables and pinnacles on the side aisle flanking the\ncemetery. The interior is distinguished by rich and structurally daring wood-\nwork and by fourteen stained-glass windows by Tiffany — out standing even\nin a city that abounds in some of the best stained glass in the country.\nRemarkable, too, is what looks to be an apse behind the altar but operates as\na pair of enormous doors that swing open to provide additional space.\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.2 DOWNTOWN: A GOlDeN TriANGle\nThe two churches on Sixth Avenue have a host of architecturally pleas-\ning neighbors. The open-air pulpit in front of First Presbyterian, an unusual\nMedieval feature, points directly across the street to the most powerful of\nthese neighbors, the Duquesne Club. The club moved to this location in 1879,\n77\nsix years after its founding, and a decade later erected its present Richardsonian\nRomanesque brownstone façade. Inside the Duquesne Club are scattered\nfifty-four dining rooms, mainly private suites maintained by major Pittsburgh\ncorporations. The role played by the club in the development of Pittsburgh\nsince 1873 can be exaggerated, but not by much. One explanation offered for\nthe peculiar bunching of skyscrapers in certain parts of the Triangle is that\nthe corporate CEOs prefer not to build too far from the Duquesne clubhouse\non Sixth Avenue. In a study of civic leadership in Pittsburgh in 1958, Arnold\nJ. Auerbach polled the executive committee of the Allegheny Conference on\nCommunity Development, with these results: twenty-four of the twenty-five\nmembers belonged to the Duquesne Club, nineteen to the Mellon-centered\nRolling Rock Club at Ligonier, and thirteen to the Fox Chapel Golf Club.\nNext door to the Duquesne Club is the former German Savings and\nDeposit Bank, now the Granite Building. This Romanesque Revival bank\nhas to be accounted among the most sumptuously textured buildings in\nPittsburgh, though in the end it becomes a fairly tedious catalogue of all the\nshapes and textures granite can assume.\nThe 300 Sixth Avenue Building, at the corner of Wood, completes the\nSixth Avenue sequence as the counterpart terra-cotta slab to the Oliver\nBuilding at the top of the block. It served for a generation as McCreery’s\nDepartment Store, then from the 1940s to the 1960s as the Spear & Company\nstore. Not having a particularly strong design to begin with, the building was\nfurther compromised by an unsympathetic rehabilitation. The new base did,\nhowever, include one superb feature: The Puddler, an illuminated stained-\nglass mural of an ironworker. It was installed in 1942 and today is one of the\nprime icons of the city.\nfig. 2.23\nThe Puddler\n© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.© 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.
