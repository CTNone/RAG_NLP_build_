The Cathedral of Learning was constructed of\nthe most iconic structure on the University’s Indiana limestone and built with the pennies, nickel and dimes\ncampus, and perhaps in all of North American of area school children. A structure expanding upward, though\ncampuses. The Cathedral of Learning is unorthodox, would solve the growing University’s problems of\nunanimously pointed to by both alumni and space and distance. More important, a tower would be a visible\nstudents as the heart of the school. The Neo inspiration to all who approached the city. It would carry the\nGothic-style pointed arch motif fills every message that education was the result of aspiring to great\naspect of the building. It became a natural heights. The parallel lines of the truncated Gothic form, never\nextension to embed that aesthetic into meeting, would imply that learning is unending. The sweeping\nthe new elements of the identity. proportions would symbolize the spirit and achievement of\nPittsburgh. Architect Charles Z. Klauder translated these\nconcepts into drawings that guided the placement\nof steel and stone.\nPITT ATHLETICS BRAND IDENTITY 20BRAND IDENTITY PANTHER HEAD LOGO\nINSPIRATION\nPITT ATHLETICS BRAND IDENTITY 21BRAND IDENTITY PANTHER HEAD LOGO\nINSPIRATION\nThe Panther Head logo is a culmination of the beloved panther\nstatues spread across the campus. That sculptural aesthetic and\naggressiveness has been captured in this new mark. However,\nthere are design cues that visually connect to the arched motif\nfrom the Cathedral of Learning. The forward-facing angle is a\nnod to the panther fountain at the front entrance of that building.\nMASCOT HISTORY\nThe adoption of the panther mascot dates back to 1909, during\na meeting of student and alumni leaders. According to alumnus\nGeorge M.P. Baird, who first suggested the idea, Felis Concolor\nwas chosen as the University’s mascot for the following reasons:\n(1) it was the most formidable creature once indigenous to the\nPittsburgh region; (2) it had ancient, heraldic standing as a\nnoble animal; (3) the happy accident of alliteration; (4) the close\napproximation of its hue to the gold of Pitt’s colors, blue and old\ngold; and (5) no other college or university then employed\nit as a symbol.\nPITT ATHLETICS BRAND IDENTITY 22BRAND IDENTITY PRIMARY IDENTITY PITT PANTHER\nPITT ATHLETICS BRAND IDENTITY 23BRAND IDENTITY PRIMARY IDENTITY PITT PANTHER – FULL COLOR\nThe logo can ONLY be used in the color variations shown below.\nNOTE: Use good judgment to ensure legibility.

The\nCathedral Stripe is a distinguishing brand element that evokes\nconsistency, adds another layer of story telling and ultimately\na sense of pride in the institution.\nThe repeat of the pointed arches is the most literal nod to the\nCathedral of Learning. The repetition of the shape is not only\na literal nod to the aesthetic of the building, but also tells the\nstory of strength in numbers. Arches support the pressure of\nthe building. The more there are, the more that pressure is\ndispersed. This same ideal applies to a team mentality\nin the athletic realm.\nLimited/Restricted Use.
