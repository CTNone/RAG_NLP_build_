The special needs of seniors are a critical part of our health care challenge. By focusing on helping seniors maintain or even enhance their level of health, UPMC is working to improve their quality of life and preserve their independence. We also are seeking out ways to reduce the cost of care for seniors, as well as society. In cooperation with our strategic allies, UPMC is bringing the right range of support and services to those who need them in their homes, in our hospitals, and in UPMC and independent retirement communities across the region. 12 UPMC 2011 COMMUNITY BENEFITs REPORTWORKING TOGETHER FOR A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY 139 TH UPMC S RAnk In geRIATRICS In U.S. NewS world report S 2011 SURvey Of neARLy 2,000 AMeRICAn HOSPITALS 8,000 CLInICIAnS, CARegIveRS, And OTHeRS WHO LeARned AbOUT SenIORS needS vIA OUR AgeLeSS WISdOM PROgRAM 494,000 UPMC HOMe HeALTH vISITS deLIveRed TO SenIORS And OTHeRS WITH CHROnIC COndITIOnS 14 UPMC 2011 COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTCaring for our seniors fisCal year 2011 helPing seniors sTay healThy, inDePenDenT our CHALLENGES UPMC Senior Communities opened Cumberland Woods Village, the first independent and assisted living facility in Allegheny County to share a campus with a state-of-the-art hospital, UPMC Passavant.

To sharpen that skillset, the Aging Institute of UPMC Senior Services and the University of Pittsburgh has developed Ageless Wisdom, a class that allows clinicians, caregivers, and others throughout the region to walk in seniors shoes. While our people are all professionals, working with elderly residents is certainly a niche, and a different type of setting than they may be used to, says Vicki Loucks, director of a system of independent senior facilities. Loucks brought in the Aging Institute to train her staff at Redstone Highlands Senior Living Communities. Using ingenious aids such as eyeglasses that simulate a range of vision problems and devices that simulate age-associated mobility challenges, the program enables staff members to experience the personal situations of residents. It also positions them to provide better care for residents, and to catch medically associated changes early potentially avoiding hospitalization and the loss of independence. It s been well-received, even by people who ve The Institute s been in the business forever, says Loucks, who s also become an Ageless Wisdom instructor.

Fortunately, new types of medicine and care management approaches are emerging to meet patients needs better than ever before. UPMC continues to deliver leading-edge care for chronic conditions. Our clinicians and our nationally recognized health insurance organization work in an innovative partnership to identify what treatments work best, and when prevention can make treatment unnecessary.
