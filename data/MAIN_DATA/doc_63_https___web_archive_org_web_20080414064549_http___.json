The United States\nwas in the midst of the Depression. Nazi Germany\nwas gaining power throughout Europe. And in 1936,\na very tense world turned its attention to Berlin and\nthe Olympic games.\nThat same year, a young man from Connellsville,\nPennsylvania, arrived at the University of Pittsburgh\ndestined to make history. As a freshman, John\nWoodruff immediately won gold at the Penn Re-\nlays and NCAA Championships. His amazing jour-\nney had only just begun as he found himself as\none of only 12 African-American members of the\nUnited States Olympic Team.\nWoodruff’s incredible story continued over to the\n800 meters, where he made one of the most in-\ncredible moves ever seen in Olympic competition.\nHe became the first African-American runner to win\na gold medal at the 1936 Olympics. And had it not\nbeen for the World War II, he may have won many\nmore.\nHe entered the military in 1941 after graduating\nfrom Pitt with a degree in sociology in 1939. He\nalso served during the Korean War. True to form,\nhe spent his career in the service of others. His\nhumble demeanor away from the track belied his\ndominance as an athlete on the track. While at Pitt\nhe won three national collegiate championships,\nfour IC4A championships and held the world record\nin the half-mile.\nAs fate would have it, Woodruff suffered the\namputation of both of his legs five years ago due to\ncirculatory problems and a broken hip. This year, “Not that the feet made the man, nor\non this 70th anniversary of the Berlin Olympics we even his feat.
