Washington\nThe\neconomy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nis diversified, focused on\nservices\n,\nmedicine\n,\nhigher education\n,\ntourism\n,\nbanking\n,\ncorporate headquarters\nand high\ntechnology\n. Once the center of the American\nsteel industry\n, and still known as \"\nThe Steel City\n\", today the city of\nPittsburgh\nhas no\nsteel mills\nwithin its limits, though Pittsburgh-based companies such as\nUS Steel\n,\nAmpco Pittsburgh\nand\nAllegheny Technologies\nown several working mills in the\nPittsburgh metropolitan area\n.\nPittsburgh was chosen for the\n2009 G-20 summit\nas its transformation is an example of a 21st-century economy. On September 8, 2009, President\nBarack Obama\nstated, \"Pittsburgh stands as a bold example of how to create new jobs and industries while transitioning to a 21st century economy.\"\n[\n1\n]\nOn the list of best cities for job growth in 2009, created by Tara Weiss, a writer for\nForbes\nmagazine, Pittsburgh secured its spot because of its strength in the health care and education industries with healthy foundations in technology or robotics and banking industries.\n[\n2\n]\nThe 2009 list of all cities places Pittsburgh as the 169th-best city for job growth.\n[\n3\n]\nPittsburgh has also ranked in the top five\nmost livable cities\nin four of the seven multi-year rankings of\nPlaces Rated Almanac\n(1983, 1985, 1989, and 2007).\n[\n4\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of Pittsburgh\nEarly foundation\n[\nedit\n]\nEarly look at Pittsburgh\nDuring the mid-18th century, the economy of the Pittsburgh region was focused on agriculture and trade. After the\nAmerican Revolutionary War\n, the government placed a tax on whiskey in order to pay off national debt. In 1794, the\nWhiskey Rebellion\noccurred in Pittsburgh and was the first challenge to the government.“The fledgling Federal government had decided to levy its first tax against\nwhiskey\n, but the farmers argued they didn't have cash to pay taxes on bartered goods, and marched in protest. Washington had to send troops to squelch the protest and enforce the tax laws.”\n[\n5\n]\nDuring the 18th century, large coal deposits were discovered throughout Pittsburgh.\nMount Washington\n, originally called \"Coal Hill\", the “most valuable deposit of bituminous coal in the entire United States, was discovered there in 1760”.\n[\n6\n]\nAlong with the natural resources of the area, Pittsburgh was located at the intersection of the\nMonongahela\n,\nOhio\n, and\nAllegheny\nRivers, that is, along the major trade routes of the United States, thus making Pittsburgh \"one of the world's leading industrial powerhouses\".\n“The first and largest industry emerging in the 1800s was boat building—both flatboats to transport waves of pioneers and goods downriver, and keelboats, which a strong crew could propel upstream as well.”\n[\n5\n]\nThe second biggest industry in the region was\nglass production\n. The first glass factory was built in 1795 by James O'Hara and\nIsaac Craig\n.\n[\n5\n]\nNineteenth century\n[\nedit\n]\nPittsburgh’s wealthiest industrialists during the 19th century all lived in a single neighborhood known as\nEast Liberty\n. The major list of industrialists includes\nH. J. Heinz\n,\nGeorge Westinghouse\n,\nAndrew Carnegie\n,\nThomas Mellon\n,\nAndrew Mellon\n,\nHenry Clay Frick\nand\nPhilander Knox\n. All of these men shared similar ideas in the system of\ncapitalism\nand utilized their skills to net the world’s highest income per capita during the 19th century in this single neighborhood.\n[\n7\n]\nAndrew Carnegie was also known as a\nphilanthropist\nto the region. “In 1889 he wrote \"\nThe Gospel of Wealth\n\", in which he asserted that all personal wealth beyond that required to supply the needs of one's family should be regarded as a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of the community”.\n[\n8\n]\nSubsequently, the\nCarnegie Library\n, which is free to the public, opened in Pittsburgh in 1890 and is still open presently.\n[\n9\n]\nOverall, Carnegie donated over $350 million for the establishment of organizations that benefit the public.\n[\n8\n]\nWealthy industrialists founded the\nDuquesne Club\nin 1873 and the\nGreater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce\nin 1874. The\nPittsburgh Stock Exchange\nwas also formed in 1864 as the \"Oil Exchange\" before becoming the \"Coal Exchange\" in 1870 and then back to the \"Oil Exchange\" in 1878 until opening for all general stocks by 1894.  The stock exchange closed its\nFourth Avenue\n\"financial district\" doors in August 1974 after computerization had consolidated trades in New York, Chicago and other global centers but not before a 1966 response from the New York Stock Exchange board of possibly relocating their trading floor to the city's facilities.\n[\n10\n]\nRailroad networks reached the Pittsburgh area in the mid-19th century. The\nOhio and Pennsylvania Railroad\nopened in 1851, which allowed passengers to travel through Allegheny and\nNew Brighton\nwhile the\nPennsylvania Railroad\nestablished \"Pittsburgh service\" as close as\nTurtle Creek\nfrom their Philadelphia hub that same year. A year later, in 1852, the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed to\nDowntown Pittsburgh\n. In 1856, the\nAllegheny Valley Railroad\nwas built.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n11\n]\nAndrew Carnegie was one of the first to capitalize on the railways; in 1865 he founded the\nPittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works\nwhich would be an industry leader from the city until 1919.\nIn 1892, the economy of Pittsburgh faced the\nHomestead Strike\nbetween the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and the\nCarnegie Steel Company\n. After the workers' previous wage contract expired in 1892, and a new negotiation was not reached, a violent conflict ensued leaving several dead and wounded. Ultimately, The Carnegie Steel company won and had avoided union formation in Pittsburgh.\n[\n12\n]\nEmergence of \"Big Steel\"\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter Carnegie Steel was reorganized as\nU.S. Steel\nin 1901, it and\nJ&L Steel\ndominated the local economy. Several secondary players contributed to the capacity of the metro area such as\nCyclops Steel\nin\nBridgeville, Pennsylvania\nfrom 1908 until 1987,\nMesta Machinery\nin\nWest Homestead, Pennsylvania\nfrom 1898 until 1983,\nDravo Corporation\nat\nNeville Island, Pennsylvania\nuntil 1984,\n[\n13\n]\nNational Steel Corporation\nuntil 1992,\nWean United\nas an independent until 1993 (still maintaining US headquarters in the city),\nHarbison Walker Refractories\nas an independent until 1967 (while still maintaining US headquarters in the city) and the still operational\nAllegheny Technologies\nand\nAmpco Pittsburgh\n.\nBethlehem Steel\n,\nRepublic Steel\nand\nLTV Steel\nalso had large local operations.  Other major mills of the area included:\nMcKeesport Tube Works\n1872–1987\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\n1873–present\nHays Army Ammunition Plant\n1942-June 1971\nClairton Steel Works\nApril 21, 1903\n[\n16\n]\n-1984\n[\n17\n]\nDuquesne Steel Works\n1886 – October 1, 1984, employed as many as 9,000 persons in the 1940s.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nHomestead Steel Works\n1881-May 24, 1986\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nCarrie Furnace\n1884–1982\nSaxonburg Mill -1987\n[\n15\n]\nVerona Mill April 4, 1905- (two 20-gross-ton Symthe acid open hearth furnaces) (14,400 tons annually)\nMon Valley Works – Irvin Plant\n1938–present\nMidland Cyclops Steel Plant until October 15, 1982\n[\n22\n]\nMcKees Rocks, Pennsylvania\nWheel and Axel plant (Lockhart Iron and Steel and Pressed Steel Car Corp.)

At one point Pittsburgh was the eighth-largest city in America.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIn 1901, The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers organized a general\nstrike\nagainst the\nU.S. Steel Corporation\nsubsidiaries, the first strike since 1892.\n[\n29\n]\nA 1903\nPittsburgh Press\nfront page highlighted the city's being a focus point for three different railroads.\n[\n30\n]\nIn 1911 the city was being referred to as the \"Stogie capital of the nation\" with several high quality\ncigar\nmanufacturers located in the region.\n[\n31\n]\nPittsburgh produced around one third of the national output of steel by the 1920s. During this period Pittsburgh was home to the world's largest tube and pipe mill, structural steel plant, rail mill, wire manufacturing plant, bridge and construction fabricating plant.\n[\n32\n]\n\"Boat building and metal industries were later the economic base of the region. When\ncoke\nfrom\ncoal\nbegan to replace\ncharcoal\nfrom wood in iron and steel making Pittsburgh grew up as the heart of the industry. A plentiful supply of bituminous coal underlies the Pittsburgh area.\"\n[\n33\n]\nAround forty percent of the nation's coal was obtained from within 100 miles of Pittsburgh.\n[\n32\n]\nDue to the reforms of\nFranklin Roosevelt\n's\nNew Deal\n, steel unions gained success in Pittsburgh. The\nWagner Act\nof 1935 gave employees rights to self-organize in\nlabor unions\nand made it unlawful for employers to prevent or interfere with such unions.\n[\n34\n]\nBy the 1950s industrial leaders worked with regional government leaders to foster and retain more local industry; organizations such as the\nRIDC\nwere formed to further this goal.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nHowever, in the early to mid-1980s\nthe steel industry collapsed\n, leaving half of the nation's steelworkers unemployed.\n[\n37\n]\n\"The number of steel workers in the Pittsburgh area dropped from 90,000 in 1980 to 44,000 in just four years\".\n[\n38\n]\nMotor Coils manufacturing company of suburban Forest Hills and Braddock has been a leading supplier to American railroads since 1957.\n[\n39\n]\nPittsburgh was a major center for advertising and public relations firms in the 20th century such as\nKetchum\nand\nBurson-Marsteller\n.\n[\n40\n]\nRetail chains such as\nG. C. Murphy\n,\nThrift Drug\n, Thorofare,\nFisher's Big Wheel\nand\nGiant Eagle\nwere founded in the early part of the 20th century with\nPhar-Mor\ndominating local retail from the 1980s to the 2000s.  Thorofare ceased operations in 1982 and Thrift Drug was bought out by\nEckerd\nin 1996. Local stores of\nLoblaws\nclosed in 1958,\nKroger\nin 1966 (although it retains stores in nearby West Virginia counties) and\nA&P\nin 1972.\n[\n41\n]\nIGA\nclosed its area stores in the early 2000s.\n[\n42\n]\nTransition into the present economy\n[\nedit\n]\nWithin the transitional years between 1970 and 1990, Pittsburgh's Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area saw shifts in its main employers, which were the manufacturing sector. In 1970, one out of every three jobs was in the manufacturing sector. By 1980 this had slipped to one in four. In 1980, the average production worker in manufacturing was making $360.89 weekly, which was almost $70 more than the state and national average. During this period the largest group of occupational employment was blue collar. This group in 1980 accounted for almost 68 percent of the jobs market. In the 1980s, a decline in the manufacturing industry was expected. The accepted trend was that Pittsburgh would embrace “industrial robots”. Since 1955 Pittsburgh has seen a steady decline in manufacturing employment. In 1955 Pittsburgh had a population of 41.8 percent in the manufactory business. In 1980 that number had slipped to almost 25.3 percent.\n[\n43\n]\nAllegheny County\nis the center for health care and higher education employment. Higher education and health care were the biggest creators of high-wage\n[\nclarification needed\n]\njobs in the Pittsburgh region between 1999 and 2005. Education accounts for almost 80% of high-wage jobs in Allegheny County. The Pittsburgh area has seen growth in other sectors as well. Professional services, finance and wholesale trade were among the growing sectors.  However, much of this growth was outside the borders of Allegheny County. This was detrimental to the county of Allegheny; however, the growth in the outer nine counties helped to stabilize the loss of employment. With big events happening in Pittsburgh throughout the late 2000s, the tourism industry has flourished. The industry has created over 11,000 new jobs in the area, some 6,000 of them within Allegheny County.\n[\n44\n]\nPittsburgh has long been a major finance and banking center.\n[\n45\n]\nPresent situation\n[\nedit\n]\nSince 2009 Pittsburgh has hosted the annual\nDUG East\nConference.\n[\n46\n]\n[\n47\n]\n\"Total nonfarm employment, over-the-year percent change in the United States and the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, March 1999-2009\"\n[\n48\n]\nThe following is a list of the top ten private employers in Pittsburgh.\n[\n49\n]\nRank\nEmployer\nNumber of Pittsburgh employees\nProduct(s)\n1\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\n40,600\nHealth care\n2\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n12,600\nHigher education\n3\nPNC Financial Services\n9,200\nFinancial services\n4\nAllegheny Health Network\n8,900\nHealth care\n5\nGiant Eagle\n8,000\nSupermarkets\n6\nBank of New York Mellon\n7,610\nFinancial services\n7\nHighmark\n5,270\nHealth insurance\n8\nU.S. Steel\n4,700\nSteel manufacturing\n9\nCarnegie Mellon University\n4,600\nHigher education\n10\nVerizon Communications\n3,750\nTelecommunications\nPittsburgh saw fewer effects of the\n2008 financial crisis\nand the\nGreat Recession\nthan most American cities. The city's transition from heavy dependence on the manufacturing industries to an economy based on health services, education, and innovative technologies kept Pittsburgh from the worst of the recession. The housing industry never saw the over-inflation rates other regions were dealing with as housing prices rose two percent in the last quarter of 2008, while other cities in the nation saw a much higher decline percentage.\n[\n50\n]\nIn the period between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh\nMSA\nexperienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation out of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States. 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values during the same period.\n[\n51\n]\nNational non-profits\n[\nedit\n]\nSeveral national or global non-profits call Pittsburgh home including:\nLearning Disabilities Association of America (since 1963)\n[\n52\n]\nInstitute for Research, Education and Training in Addictions\n[\n53\n]\nNational Center for Juvenile Justice (since 1973)\n[\n54\n]\nColcom Foundation\n(since 1996)\nLaurel Foundation\n(since 1951)\nHeinz Endowments\nPrinting Industries of America\n(since 2003)\nTwenty-first-century progression\n[\nedit\n]\nThe shifting economy of Pittsburgh has seen changes since the 1990s; these are primarily in banking, health care and technology. However, In December 2004, Pittsburgh was forced into an\nAct 47\nbecause the finances in the city were down. In January 2003 Pittsburgh's unemployment rate reached 6.8%, but has seen a major decline in, as in April 2005 the rates were near only 4.8%.\n[\n55\n]\nSince one in every five jobs in Pittsburgh lies within the health care service, Pittsburgh was able to hold steady during the\nrecent economic downturn\n.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nDuring this, the city also began to see growth in other occupations such as the business service and construction.  The business service sectors in 2008 saw an increase of over 3,000 jobs.  During the downturn, Pittsburgh still developed many parts of the city creating over 1,000 construction jobs in the region.\n[\n58\n]\nTechnology industry\n[\nedit\n]\nPittsburgh has established itself as a technology hub with such companies as\nGoogle\n,\nApple Inc.\n,\nIntel\n,\nUber\n,\nFacebook\nand\nRAND\nestablishing campuses in the city.  The\nPittsburgh Technology Center\n,\nPittsburgh Supercomputing Center\nand\nPittsburgh LAN Coalition\nalso develop major innovations.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nCompanies such as\nDuolingo\n, Petrosoft,\nModcloth\n,\nGuru.com\n,\nSongwhale\nand others have global headquarters in the city. The\nCrons\ncompany designs motivational athletic apparel.\n[\n59\n]\n2009 G-20 Pittsburgh Summit\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\n2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit\nPittsburgh was chosen to hold the 2009 G-20 summit for multiple reasons.  Pittsburgh utilizes its past by building on previous successes in manufacturing, business services, and green energy.  \"Pittsburgh manufacturers employ almost 100,000 workers and the region is the second-largest market in the United States for metals industry employment.\"\n[\n60\n]\nPittsburgh is also home to some of the world's largest business and financial services, which supply the greatest amount to the regional economic output.  In the past, innovation in energy has been advanced through commercialization of oil, coal, and natural gas. More focus and attention is being given to the innovation in sustainability and efficiency while protecting the environment as Pittsburgh has more than 30\nLEED certified\nbuildings.\n[\n60\n]\nEconomic development plan\n[\nedit\n]\nThe State of Pennsylvania requires every county to develop a land use and growth management plan. Allegheny Places is the plan for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. It was adopted in November 2008 and is a “unique blueprint for a sustainable future envisioned by the citizens of the County”.\n[\n61\n]\nThe plan has a steering committee with over 100 members, an advisory committee with over 400 members, and a sounding board. The plan advocates a future in which:\nEquitable access to the opportunities and benefits of economic development to all residents is provided\nFormer brownfields are transformed and developed\nTransit-oriented development efforts reduce road congestion and connect the major economic areas – Oakland, Downtown, and the Pittsburgh International Airport\nThe promotion of greenways will link the community with parks, trails, riverfronts, etc.\nAffordable\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nand high-quality\n[\nclarification needed\n]\nhousing exists for all\nA diversified economy provides stable, well-paying jobs\n[\n62\n]\nThe economic development plan includes enterprise zones, research and technology developments, development of research parks, such as the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center\n, partnerships with economic development organizations, and\nventure capital\ninitiatives.\nAn\nUrban Enterprise Zone\nis a location within the inner city free from import duties, taxes, and some government regulations.\n[\n63\n]\nStudies of enterprise zones have shown increased job growth and investment. In the majority of studies, there is an apparent relationship between the creation of enterprise zones and increased economic activity in the zones. The zones also show economic activity not typical of the surrounding metropolitan area.\n[\n64\n]\nHowever, success is often questionable and subject to local conditions.\n[\n65\n]\nAllegheny County has 26 enterprise zones, in which 17 are in the City of Pittsburgh.\n[\n62\n]\nThe research and technology sector is growing due to the local universities, medical centers, the technology cluster, and the provision of financial capital to fund its development. These attributes provide the specific infrastructure required of sought-after industries.\n[\n62\n]\nTherefore, this could attract business to the region and sustain or expand existing firms, which should result in a net increase in total jobs. However, this type of development is still fairly new, which means it is difficult to draw any noteworthy conclusions about its potential. Also, the presence of universities provides the context for university-industry technology transfers, which is the effective movement of technology to industry via students trained in detailed programs to meet the detailed wants of the industry.\n[\n66\n]\nEconomic upward mobility\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to a 2014 report published by the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\n, Pittsburgh is the second-best American city for intergenerational economic mobility;\n[\n67\n]\nin other words, Pittsburgh is the second best city to achieve the\nAmerican Dream\n.\n[\n68\n]\n2013 news\n[\nedit\n]\nAs of early 2013 the largest property managers in the Pittsburgh area included\nCBRE Group\n,\n[\n69\n]\nOxford Development\n,\n[\n70\n]\nRIDC\n[\n71\n]\nand\nJones Lang Lasalle\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn August 13, 2013, the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\nreported that the\nH.
