Program\nYoung drivers between the ages of seven and 12 years got\ntheir first driving experience and a chance to commit to be “drug\nfree” on July 8 and 9, 2000 as they participated in Kmart’s Kids\nRace Against Drugs (KRAD). Those who came out drove a sleek\naerodynamically designed miniature race car, sporting the features\nof a convertible Ford Mustang. The vehicles were battery powered\nand even rode on racing style Goodyear tires.\nThese young drivers, from the Seneca Valley and Mars Area\nSchool Districts didn’t get to drive the car alone, they were accom-\npanied by a safety driver. The safety drivers were volunteers and\nlocal police officers from Cranberry, Evans City, Jackson, Mars,\nand Zelienople police departments.\n“We’d much rather meet our children in this type of situation\nthan on the streets later,” stated Sergeant Dave Lewis, Support\nServices Commander for the Cranberry Township Police Depart-\nment and coordinator of this event.\nThe course was a challenging one for the drivers. They went\nover bridges, through S-curves, around hairpin turns, and through a\ntunnel to the finish line. The drivers were timed with professional\nelectronic timing equipment similar to those used in drag racing.\nThe entire KRAD experience was FREE and every child\nwalked away a winner, complete with a KRAD t-shirt and baseball\ncap. Since many of the drivers brought their families, including\nyounger brothers and sisters, this was truly a community, family\nevent. Although the younger ones were not able to drive, the safety\ndrivers took them for a quick lap around the course and were\nrewarded with uncountable smiles.\nThe Kmart Kids Race Against Drugs family event travels to\n90 cities making more than 665 stops to show America’s children\nthat drugs and alcohol are a dead-end street. The race track is\nspecially designed to be set up in local Kmart parking lots to bring\nthe anti-drug, alcohol, and violence message to more than 700,000\nchildren throughout America.\nFor every child that raced over the two days, the Seneca\nValley and Mars D.A.R.E. programs will receive a $5 donation\nfrom the Kmart Family Foundation. These funds are used to assist\nin bringing the D.A.R.E. program to the school districts FREE of\ncharge and without assistance of local tax dollars. In 2000, local\nofficers graduated over 650 students from D.A.R.E. at Seneca\nValley, Mars, and St. Gregory’s Schools.\nThe final numbers for KRAD in Cranberry for 2000 . . . 654\nriders, raising over $3000 for the local D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse\nResistance Education) Programs. The organizers estimate that over\n150 younger riders were also treated to a free ride on the course.\nTo all those who helped and those who came out, the local school\ndistricts and police departments applaud you.
