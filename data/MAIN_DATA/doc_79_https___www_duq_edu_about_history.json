From humble beginnings as a school for the children of Pittsburgh's\n                                       poor immigrants, Duquesne today is an educational and economic powerhouse comprising\n                                       10 schools of study that serves nearly 8,200 graduate and undergraduate students.\nSome of the University's historic milestones* include:\nDuquesne was founded on\nOct. 1, 1878, as Pittsburgh Catholic College\nby the Rev.
