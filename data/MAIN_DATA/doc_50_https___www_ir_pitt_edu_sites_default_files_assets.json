FINANCIAL AID\nPlease refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.\nAwarded aid: The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.\nFinancial aid applicant: Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid\napplications/forms, such as the FAFSA.\nIndebtedness: Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized,\nunsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student\nloans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.\nInstitutional scholarships and grants: Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for\nwhich the institution determines the recipient.\nFinancial need: As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's\nown standards.\nNeed-based aid: College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other\nsources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-\ninstitutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).\nNeed-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other\nsources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.\nNeed-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a\nstudent must demonstrate financial need to qualify.\nNon-need-based scholarship or grant aid: Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from\ninstitutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income)\nawarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When\nreporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-\nbased aid.\nNote: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:\n1. Non-need institutional grants 6. Non-need outside grants\n2. Non-need tuition waivers 7. Non-need student loans\n3. Non-need athletic awards 8. Non-need parent loans\n4. Non-need federal grants 9. Non-need work\n5. Non-need state grants\nNon-need-based self-help aid: Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a\nstudent need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.\nPrivate student loans: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender\nused to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.\nExternal scholarships and grants: Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that\nstudents bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process\npaperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount\nawarded.\nWork study and employment: Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your\ninstitution in financial aid awards.\nDO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nAid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates\nH1 Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking\nundergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking”\nundergraduates) in the following categories.\n• If the data being reported are final figures for the 2020-2021 academic year (see the next item below),\nuse the 2020-2021 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.\n• Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).\n• Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid\ncolumn.\n• For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for\n“non-\n• Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPage 19Common Data Set 2021-2022\nPittsburgh Campus\n2021-2022\n2020-2021 Final\nestimated\nIndicate the academic year for which data are reported for items H1,\nX\nH2, H2A, and H6 below:\nWhich needs-analysis methodology does your institution use in awarding institutional aid?

Undergraduate Class Size\nIn the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and\nclass sections offered in the Fall 2021 term.\n• Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClass Sections: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and\nnumber, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a\nlaboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at\nleast one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes\nand noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction,\nor one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign\nlanguage taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section\nshould be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\nClass Subsections: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory,\nrecitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet\nseparately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any\nsubsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above,\nexclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music\ninstruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be\nduplicated because of cross-listings.\nUsing the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class\nsections and class subsections offered in Fall 2021. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who\nmet at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in\nthe class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.\nNumber of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled\nUndergraduate Class Size (provide numbers)\n2-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-99 100+ Total\nCLASS\n273 901 611 379 180 277 180 2801\nSECTIONS\n2-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-99 100+ Total\nCLASS SUB-\n48 158 753 125 21 44 7 1156\nSECTIONS\nPage 26Common Data Set 2021-2022\nPittsburgh Campus\nJ.
