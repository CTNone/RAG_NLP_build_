As of the 2021–2022 school year, the district operates 54 schools with 4,192 employees (2,070 teachers) and 20,350 students, and has a budget of $668.3 million.\n[\n3\n]\nThe budget per student for the 2018-19 school year averaging to approximately $22,961.\n[\n4\n]\nAccording to the district's 2021 budget, based on the\n2010 U.S. census\n, the combined land area served is 55.3 square miles (143 km\n2\n), with a population of 309,359.\n[\n5\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe formation of\nPittsburgh\n's public schools in 1835 was due to the passing of the Pennsylvania Free Public School Act of 1834. This act provided government aid for establishing a city school system, which included the creation of four self-governed wards. Twenty years later, the wards were disbanded, and the Central Board of Education was founded. This board would govern the entire school district, which would consist of nine wards or sub- districts. The first city superintendent of schools was elected in 1868. In 1911, the School Code of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania\nmodified the existing system to include a Board of Public education that would oversee sixty-one sub-districts and two central boards. The Public School Code (Title 22) of 1949 further regulated the provisions and establishment of Pennsylvania state schools.\n[\n1\n]\nAs stated in numerous district annual budgets, including 2021, \"Although public education in Pittsburgh dates back to 1835, the consolidated District was founded in November 1911, as a result of an educational reform movement that combined the former 'ward' schools into one system with standardized educational and business policies. Initially the district was governed by an appointed Board of 15 members, but since 1976 has been governed by a nine-member Board elected by districts of relatively equal populations.\"\n[\n5\n]\nAcademics\n[\nedit\n]\nIn February 2006, eight underperforming schools were transformed into Accelerated Learning Academies (ALAs).\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nThe schools had 10 days added to their school calendar and 45 minutes of instructional time were added each day.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe ALAs use the\nAmerica's Choice\nDesign Model,\n[\n10\n]\ndeveloped by the\nNational Center on Education and the Economy\n.\nIn March 2006, the district contracted with\nKaplan K12 Learning Services\nto develop a single, district-wide curriculum.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Pittsburgh Promise\n[\nedit\n]\nOn December 13, 2006\nPittsburgh\nMayor\nLuke Ravenstahl\nand then Superintendent\nMark Roosevelt\nannounced an initiative called The Pittsburgh Promise. In 2008, the program became available to all graduates satisfying the criteria for a scholarship to any accredited\npost-secondary\ninstitution within Pennsylvania. The five to seven million dollars per year necessary to fund the program would be raised through private contributions from foundations and corporations.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nIn January 2007, the\nPittsburgh Federation of Teachers\nmade the first contribution to\nThe Pittsburgh Promise\nscholarship program.\n[\n14\n]\nIn 2008, the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\nmade a $10 million donation with a commitment for as much as $90 million in additional matching funds over the next nine years.\n[\n15\n]\nSince its founding, the program has helped nearly 12,000 students attend college by funneling $170 million into fees, tuition, and living expenses.\n[\n16\n]\nIn September 2023, the Pittsburgh Promise's executive director, Saleem Ghubril, sent a letter to district parents explaining that the Pittsburgh Public Schools' Class of 2028 will be the final group of students to receive scholarships.\n[\n17\n]\nBoard of Public Education of Pittsburgh\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Pittsburgh Public Schools has an elected, nine-member board of directors. The members serve a four-year term and represent districts within the city and the nearby borough of Mount Oliver.\n[\n18\n]\nLike all other school board members in Pennsylvania, they receive no pay.\n[\n19\n]\nSuperintendent of Schools and Administration\n[\nedit\n]\nOn July 21, 2022, the Pittsburgh Board of Education announced that Dr. Wayne N. Walters will serve as Superintendent of Pittsburgh Public Schools.\n[\n20\n]\nOn August 1, 2022, Dr. Walters took over the top leadership position after serving as interim Superintendent for a 10-month period. The school district has various administrative departments: Office of the Superintendent, Student Support Services, Athletics, Human Resources, Curriculm and Instruction, Data, Research, Evaluation and Assessment, Facilities, Finance, and Law.\nSchools\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of public schools in Pittsburgh\nElementary schools (K–5)\n[\nedit\n]\nAllegheny Traditional Academy Elementary School\nArsenal Elementary School\nBanksville Elementary School\nBeechwood Elementary School\nConcord Elementary School\nDilworth Traditional Academy\nFaison K-5\nFulton Academy of Geographic and Life Sciences\nGrandview Elementary School\nLincoln School\n(two campuses: K–4 & 5–8)\nLiberty Elementary School\nLinden Elementary School\nMiller African Centered Academy\nMinadeo Elementary School\nPhillips K-5\nPittsburgh Montessori (also: Pre-K)\nRoosevelt Elementary School (two campuses: Pre-K–1 & 2–5)\nSpring Hill Elementary School\nWeil PreK-5\nWest Liberty Elementary School\nWestwood Elementary School\nWhittier Elementary School\nWoolslair Elementary School\nK–8 schools\n[\nedit\n]\nArlington\nBrookline School\nCarmalt Academy of Science and Technology\nColfax K-8\nGreenfield School\nKing PreK-8\nLangley\nManchester PreK-8\nMifflin School\nMorrow Elementary School\nSunnyside PreK-8\nMiddle schools (6–8) and Accelerated Learning Academies\n[\nedit\n]\nAllegheny Traditional Academy Middle School\nArlington\nArsenal Middle School\nPittsburgh Classical Academy Middle School\nSchiller Classical Academy Middle School\nSouth Brook Middle School\nSouth Hills Middle School\nSterrett Classical Academy\nWeil PreK-5\nSecondary schools, grades 9-12 and 6-12\n[\nedit\n]\nBarack Obama Academy of International Studies 6-12\nBrashear High School\nCarrick High School\nPerry Traditional Academy\nPittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School\n(6–12)\nPittsburgh Science and Technology Academy\n(6–12)\nTaylor Allderdice High School\nUniversity Preparatory School\n(6–12)\nWestinghouse High School\nSpecial schools\n[\nedit\n]\nConroy Education Center\nOliver Citywide Academy\nPioneer Education Center\nPittsburgh Gifted Center\nStudent Achievement Center High School\nStudent Achievement Center Middle School\nClayton Academy\nPittsburgh Online Academy\nCharter schools\n[\nedit\n]\nAs required by\nPennsylvania\nstate law, the district funds a number of\ncharter schools\n:\n[\n21\n]\nAcademy Charter School (9–12)\nCareer Connections Charter High School\n(9–12) – Charter renewed for five years on 21 March 2007\n[\n22\n]\nCity Charter High School\n(9–12) – Charter renewed for five years on 8 November 2006\n[\n23\n]\nThe Environmental Charter School at Frick Park K–8\nHill House Passport Academy Charter School\nManchester Academic Charter School (K–8)\nNorthside Urban Pathways Charter School (6–12)\nRenaissance Academy of Pittsburgh Alternative of Hope (K–5) – Charter renewal denied by board on 25 April 2006\n[\n24\n]\nUrban League of Pittsburgh Charter School (K–5)\nCareer Connections Charter Middle School – closed 2006\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nList of school districts in Pennsylvania\nNotes and references\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\n\"Historical Sketch of the Pittsburgh Public Schools\"\n.\nHistoric Pittsburgh\n.
