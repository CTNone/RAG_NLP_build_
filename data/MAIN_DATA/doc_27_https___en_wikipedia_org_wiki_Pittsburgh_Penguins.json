The Penguins compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team has played its home games at\nPPG Paints Arena\nsince 2010, and has previously played at the\nCivic Arena\n, which was better known by its nickname \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are affiliated with two\nminor league\nteams – the\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\nof the\nAmerican Hockey League\n(AHL) and the\nWheeling Nailers\nof the\nECHL\n.\nFounded during the\n1967 expansion\n, the Penguins have qualified for six\nStanley Cup Finals\n, winning the\nStanley Cup\nfive times – in\n1991\n,\n1992\n,\n2009\n,\n2016\n, and\n2017\n. Along with the\nEdmonton Oilers\n, the Penguins are tied for the most\nStanley Cup championships\namong the non-\nOriginal Six\nteams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the\nsalary cap\nera. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, including co-owner\nMario Lemieux\n, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux,\nJaromir Jagr\n,\nSidney Crosby\n, and\nEvgeni Malkin\nhave won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nwhile playing for the franchise.\nHistory\nEarly years (1967–1984)\nPrior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's\nPittsburgh Pirates\nfrom 1925 to 1930 and of the\nAmerican Hockey League\n's\nPittsburgh Hornets\nfranchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965,\nJack McGregor\n, a\nstate senator\nfrom\nKittanning, Pennsylvania\n, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an\nurban renewal\ntool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included\nH. J. Heinz Company\nheir\nH. J. Heinz III\n,\nPittsburgh Steelers\n' owner\nArt Rooney\nand the\nMellon family\n's\nRichard Mellon Scaife\n. The\nprojected league expansion\ndepended on securing votes from the\nthen-current NHL owners\n; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from\nJames D. Norris\n, owner of the\nChicago Black Hawks\nand his brother\nBruce Norris\n, owner of the\nDetroit Red Wings\n. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the\nNational Hockey League\nawarded an\nexpansion team\nto Pittsburgh for the\n1967–68 season\n. The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The\nCivic Arena\n's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThe\nCivic Arena\n's capacity was increased to meet NHL requirements for a franchise. The arena served as the Penguins' home arena from 1967 to 2010.\nA contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the\nathletic department\nof the newly named\nYoungstown State University\nin nearby\nYoungstown, Ohio\n. (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the\nCleveland Barons\nin the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena),\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\na logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \"\nGolden Triangle\n\" of downtown Pittsburgh.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe Penguins' first general manager,\nJack Riley\n, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in\nBrantford, Ontario\n,\n[\n10\n]\non September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\non September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper\nAndy Bathgate\n, all-star defenseman\nLeo Boivin\n(who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and\nNew York Rangers\n' veteran\nEarl Ingarfield\n, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers\nVal Fonteyne\nand\nAb McDonald\n, and goaltenders\nHank Bassen\nand\nJoe Daley\n.\nGeorge Sullivan\nwas named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.\n[\n11\n]\nOn October 11, 1967, league president\nClarence Campbell\nand McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n5\n]\nOn October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime\nCleveland Barons\nAHL goaltender\nLes Binkley\n, who recorded a 2.88\ngoals-against average\nand was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger\nKen Schinkel\nwon the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the\nNHL All-Star Game\n. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the\nSt. Louis Blues\nin exchange for center\nLou Angotti\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThe\nnext season\nsaw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players – including longtime future Penguins star\nJean Pronovost\n– making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains.\nTriumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969–1974)\nMichel Briere\n's number was taken out of circulation after his career-ending accident in 1970. It was later formally retired in 2001.\nIn the\n1969 draft\nthe Penguins selected\nMichel Briere\nwho, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to\nPhil Esposito\nand\nBobby Clarke\n. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nvoting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender\nTony Esposito\n. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the\nOakland Seals\nin a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semifinals, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native\nQuebec\n, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001.\n[\n6\n]\nIn the\n1970–71 season\n, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in\n1972\n, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost,\nSyl Apps Jr.\n,\nKeith McCreary\n, agitator\nBryan Watson\nand goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\nThe Penguins battled the\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nfor the division cellar in\n1974\n, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by\nJack Button\n. Button obtained\nSteve Durbano\n,\nAb DeMarco\n,\nBob \"Battleship\" Kelly\nand\nBob Paradise\nthrough trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28–41–9 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.\nHowever, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into\nbankruptcy\n. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate.\n[\n12\n]\nAround the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to\nSeattle\nand\nDenver\nrespectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the\n1976–77 season\n.\n[\n13\n]\nThrough the intervention of a group that included former\nMinnesota North Stars\nhead coach\nWren Blair\n, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by\nshopping mall\nmagnate\nEdward J. DeBartolo, Sr.\nPlayoff runs and a uniform change (1974–1982)\nDuring the mid-1970s,\nLowell MacDonald\nwas paired with\nSyl Apps Jr.\nand\nJean Pronovost\n, forming the \"Century\nLine\n\". MacDonald played with the Penguins from 1970 to 1978.\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps,\nLowell MacDonald\nand Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the semifinals in\n1975\n, but were ousted from the playoffs by the\nNew York Islanders\nin one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season.\nBaz Bastien\n, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in\n1977–78\n. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the\nBuffalo Sabres\nbefore a second-round sweep at the hands of the\nBoston Bruins\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThe Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the\nPittsburgh Pirates\nand the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the\nFlag of Pittsburgh\n. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.\n[\n14\n]\nOn the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman\nRandy Carlyle\n, and prolific scorers\nPaul Gardner\nand\nMike Bullard\nbut little else.\nDuring the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the\n1982 playoffs\n, the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by\nJohn Tonelli\n, who had tied the game before.\n[\n15\n]\nIt would be the Penguins' final playoff appearance until\n1989\n.\nLemieux–Jagr era (1984–2005)\nMario Lemieux\nplayed for the Penguins in two stints (1984–1997, 2000–2006).\nThe team had the league's worst record in both the\n1982–83\nand\n1983–84\nseasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate.\nMario Lemieux\n, one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the\n1984 NHL entry draft\n. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the\nNew Jersey Devils\n, who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management.\n[\n16\n]\nPittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\nthat a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.\n[\n17\n]\nOther teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman\nPaul Coffey\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\n(after the Oilers'\n1987 Stanley Cup\nwin) and bringing in young talent like scorers\nKevin Stevens\n,\nRob Brown\nand\nJohn Cullen\nfrom the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of\nTom Barrasso\nfrom Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Penguins; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. In\n1985–86\n, the Penguins missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In\n1986–87\n, they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In\n1987–88\n, for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game.\n[\n11\n]\nIn 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.\n[\n11\n]\nBack-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989–1997)\nA\nherniated disc\nin Lemieux's back cut short his\n1989–90 season\n, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings (\nBryan Trottier\n) and trades (\nJoe Mullen\n,\nLarry Murphy\n,\nRon Francis\nand\nUlf Samuelsson\n) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted\nJaromir Jagr\nwith the fifth overall pick in the\n1990 NHL entry draft\n. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\nThe roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nin six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the\n1991 Stanley Cup Finals\n, the Penguins met with President\nGeorge H. W. Bush\n, the first NHL team ever to visit the\nWhite House\n.\n[\n18\n]\nThe following season, the team lost coach\nBob Johnson\nto\ncancer\n, and\nScotty Bowman\ntook over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in\n1991–92\n.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n11\n]\nCancer diagnosis revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with\nHodgkin lymphoma\n. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth\nArt Ross Trophy\nas scoring champion with 160 points, edging out\nPat LaFontaine\nand\nAdam Oates\n. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the\nPresidents' Trophy\n. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of the success, the\n1993 playoffs\nended in the division finals when the New York Islanders eliminated the Penguins in seven games.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThe Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards:\nAlexei Kovalev\n,\nMartin Straka\n,\nAleksey Morozov\n,\nRobert Lang\nand\nPetr Nedved\n, and defensemen\nSergei Zubov\n,\nDarius Kasparaitis\nand\nKevin Hatcher\n. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the\nWashington Capitals\nin six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the\nFlorida Panthers\nin seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.\n[\n11\n]\nLemieux's retirement and return (1997–2001)\nLemieux with the Penguins during the\n2000–01 season\n, his first season after coming out of retirement.\nOn April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\nin the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.\nThe Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the\nToronto Maple Leafs\nin six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4–1 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2 in the second round.\nBy this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners\nHoward Baldwin\nand\nMorris Belzberg\n(who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for\nChapter 11\nbankruptcy in November 1998.\nLemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity – enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon\nRonald Burkle\n) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.\n[\n6\n]\nLemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the\n2001 playoffs\n, highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the conference finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.\n[\n6\n]\nRebuilding (2001–2005)\nMarc-Andre Fleury\nwas drafted first overall in\n2003\nby the Penguins.\nThe Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998–99, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.\n[\n19\n]\nReducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in\n2002\n, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The\nfollowing season\nthey finished second-last. In the\n2003 NHL entry draft\n, the Penguins selected goaltender\nMarc-Andre Fleury\nwith the first overall pick.\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nThe\n2003–04 season\nwas an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout.\n[\n19\n]\nAs the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator)\nEddie Olczyk\nand opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL entry draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the\n2004 NHL entry draft\n(\nAlexander Ovechkin\n), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center\nEvgeni Malkin\n, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the\nInternational Ice Hockey Federation\n(IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut.\n[\n22\n]\nBy this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to\nKansas City, Missouri\n.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nA\nlockout\nprompted the cancellation of the\n2004–05 NHL season\n. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the\nOttawa Senators\n, which had filed for bankruptcy protection.\n[\n27\n]\nDuring the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\n, and to European leagues.\n[\n6\n]\nCrosby–Malkin era (2005–present)\nSidney Crosby\nduring his\nsophomore season\nwith the Penguins. He was drafted first overall by the team in the\n2005 draft\n.\nWith the lockout resolved in 2005, the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the\n2005 NHL entry draft\nselection order. The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a \"secure location\", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick.\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nQuebec Major Junior Hockey League\n(QMJHL) superstar\nSidney Crosby\n(who had been training with Lemieux over the summer)\n[\n28\n]\nwas the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the\nRussian Superleague\n. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005–06 season.\n[\n19\n]\nHowever, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to\nMichel Therrien\n. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an\nirregular heartbeat\n, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to\nWayne Gretzky\n's 1.92.\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nDespite the team's struggles, Crosby established himself as a star in the league, amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the\n2006 NHL entry draft\n, and selected touted two-way forward\nJordan Staal\n. The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager\nCraig Patrick\n, who had been the general manager since December 1989.\n[\n33\n]\nOn May 25,\nRay Shero\nsigned a five-year contract as general manager.\nRunner–up and third Stanley Cup title (2006–2010)\nEvgeni Malkin\nmade an immediate impact, driving the Penguins to their first playoff appearance in six years.\nChange came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games.\n[\n34\n]\nThe Penguins finished the\n2006–07 season\nin fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47–24–11, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the\n2007 playoffs\nthe eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4–1. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won.\nOn March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's governor\nEd Rendell\n,\nAllegheny County\nchief executive\nDan Onorato\n, Pittsburgh's mayor\nLuke Ravenstahl\nand Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The completion of\nConsol Energy Center\nguaranteed that the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million\nbond\nwas issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year\nlease\non September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040.\n[\n35\n]\nAfter a mediocre start to the\n2007–08 season\n, Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title – their first division title in 10 years – with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the\nHart Memorial Trophy\n. The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 to clinch the\nPrince of Wales Trophy\n. Pittsburgh lost the\n2008 Stanley Cup Finals\nto the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying\nConn Smythe Trophy\n-winner\nHenrik Zetterberg\n(13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.\nCrosby,\nBill Guerin\n, and\nChris Kunitz\nduring the\n2009 Stanley Cup Finals\n. The Penguins defeated the\nDetroit Red Wings\nin the Finals, earning their third Stanley Cup title.\nIn the\n2008–09 season\n, Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after\nDan Bylsma\nreplaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the\nCarolina Hurricanes\nin a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the\nStanley Cup Finals\nagainst the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in\nDetroit\n, like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit,\nMaxime Talbot\nscored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2–1 to win their third Stanley Cup title.\n[\n36\n]\nMalkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\n[\n11\n]\nDuring the\n2009–10 season\n, Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the\nMaurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy\nas the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive game 7, which the Penguins lost 5–2, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena.\n[\n37\n]\nNew arena and injuries (2010–2015)\nOutside of\nConsol Energy Center\n(now PPG Paints Arena) in March 2010 before it officially opened.\nThe Penguins hosted the\nWashington Capitals\nat\nHeinz Field\nduring the\n2011 Winter Classic\n.\nIn\n2010–11\n, the Penguins played their first game in\nConsol Energy Center\n. On February 11, 2011, the\nPittsburgh Penguins–New York Islanders brawl\ntook place.\n[\n38\n]\nA season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3–1 series lead to\nTampa Bay Lightning\n, with Fleury's goaltending called into question.\n[\n39\n]\nWith Crosby still sidelined with\npost-concussion syndrome\n, at the start of the\n2011–12 season\n, Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the\n2012 playoffs\nwith high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games.\n[\n40\n]\nMalkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and\nLester B. Pearson award\n. Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the\n2012 NHL entry draft\nfor the upcoming\n2012–13 season\n.\n[\n41\n]\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the\nlockout\n-shortened 2012–13 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the conference finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million.\n[\n43\n]\nOn July 1, 2015, the Penguins acquired right-winger\nPhil Kessel\nin a multi-player deal.\nIn the\n2013–14 season\n, the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team\nMetropolitan Division\n, though the club struggled in the\nplayoffs\n, requiring six games to defeat the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3–1 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with\nJim Rutherford\n, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes.\n[\n44\n]\nRutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that\nMike Johnston\nwas hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the\n2014–15 season\n, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the\nmumps\n, the team fell to fourth in the division. The Penguins lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger\nPhil Kessel\n.\n[\n45\n]\nBack-to-back Stanley Cups and 50th anniversary (2015–2017)\nAfter acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015–16 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15–10–3 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with\nMike Sullivan\n, who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.\n[\n46\n]\nThis move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\nCrosby with the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade. The team won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in\n2016\n.\nThe Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the\nplayoffs\n, the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4–1 series, the Capitals 4–2 and the Lightning 4–3 to win the Eastern Conference championship, advancing to the\nStanley Cup Finals\nagainst the\nSan Jose Sharks\n.\n[\n49\n]\nOn June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4–2 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\n[\n50\n]\nThe Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington.\n[\n51\n]\nThe Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the\n2017 playoffs\n, defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the conference finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the\nStanley Cup Finals\n, where they faced the\nNashville Predators\n. The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the\n1997–98 Detroit Red Wings\nto defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era.\n[\n6\n]\nPatric Hornqvist\ncelebrates the\n2017 Stanley Cup\n-clinching goal against the\nNashville Predators\n.\nPlayoff streak (2017–2023)\nBefore the\n2017–18 season\n, the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the\n2017 NHL expansion draft\nto the\nVegas Golden Knights\n.\n[\n52\n]\nNevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games.\n[\n53\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round.\n[\n54\n]\nIn the following season, which was shortened by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n, the team advanced to the\n2020 playoffs\n, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round.\n[\n55\n]\nOn February 9, 2021, the Penguins named\nRon Hextall\nas their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons.\nBrian Burke\nwas hired as president of hockey operations.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\nOn February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach\n1,000 NHL games\nfor the team.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Penguins won the\nEast Division\ntitle, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons.\n[\n59\n]\nThis became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the\nSan Antonio Spurs\nmissing the\n2020 NBA playoffs\n.\n[\n60\n]\nThe\n2020–21 season\ncame to an end in game 6 of the first round of the\n2021 playoffs\nagainst the New York Islanders.\n[\n61\n]\nOn November 29, 2021,\nFenway Sports Group\nannounced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins.\n[\n62\n]\nOn December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins.\n[\n63\n]\nIn the first round of the\n2022 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Penguins lost in seven games to the\nNew York Rangers\ndespite having a 3–1 series lead. The game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6–0 the previous six instances.\n[\n64\n]\nThe\n2022–23 season\nwas marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022,\nEvgeni Malkin\nplayed his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform.\n[\n65\n]\nThis would be followed up only months later, when teammate\nKris Letang\nwould play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season.\n[\n66\n]\nHowever, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005–06, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in dismissals of Burke and Hextall.\n[\n67\n]\n[\n68\n]\nDubas era (2023–present)\nOn June 1, 2023,\nKyle Dubas\nwas named the team's new president of hockey operations.\n[\n69\n]\nOn August 6, the Penguins traded for\nNorris Trophy\n-winning defenseman\nErik Karlsson\nin a three-team deal also involving the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n70\n]\nOn February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favorite forward\nJake Guentzel\n, trading him to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n.\n[\n71\n]\nDespite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season When the\nDetroit Red Wings\ndefeated the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin overtime while the Capitals defeated the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, clinching the final spot as the second wild card.\n[\n72\n]\nTeam information\nCrest and sweater design\nWhen the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the\nGolden Triangle\nof downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed.\n[\n73\n]\nThe team's colors were originally\npowder blue\n,\nnavy blue\n, and white. The powder blue was changed to\nroyal blue\nin 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the\nPittsburgh Pirates\nin the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old\nPittsburgh Police\nuniforms,\n[\n74\n]\nbeginning the black and gold color tradition in the city.\n[\n73\n]\nThe Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983–84 season.\n[\n73\n]\nIn the\n1992–93 season\n, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo, or \"Robopenguin\".\n[\n75\n]\n[\n76\n]\nThe team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second\nalternate jersey\n, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the \"skating penguin\" logo, but with a \"Vegas gold\" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the \"skating penguin\" was readopted as the primary, though the \"flying penguin\" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995–2002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders.\n[\n73\n]\nThroughout the 2016–17 season, a commemorative patch was added to the uniforms to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary.\nThe Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the\n2003–04 NHL season\n. The team wore their powder blue, 1968–1972 \"\nthrowbacks\n\" against the Buffalo Sabres in the\n2008 Winter Classic\n. This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the\n2011 Winter Classic\n.\n[\n77\n]\nFor the 2011–12 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired.\n[\n78\n]\nCalled the \"Blue Jerseys of Doom\" by the\nPittsburgh Tribune-Review\n, the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a\nconcussion\nin the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms.\n[\n73\n]\n[\n79\n]\n[\n80\n]\nIn 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured \"Pittsburgh gold\", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002.\n[\n81\n]\nThe Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black \"Pittsburgh gold\" alternates, thus retiring the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016–17 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary.\n[\n82\n]\nDuring the\n2017 Stadium Series\nagainst the\narchrival\nPhiladelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a \"City of Champions\" patch and a variation of the \"skating penguin\" logo.\n[\n83\n]\nThis design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018–19 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms.\n[\n84\n]\nThe Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the\n2019 Stadium Series\n.\n[\n85\n]\nIn 2021, the Penguins wore white \"Reverse Retro\" uniforms based on the 1992–97 uniforms. This set replaced the \"flying penguin\" with the alternate \"skating penguin\" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders.\n[\n86\n]\nA black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021–22 season.\n[\n87\n]\nIn the 2022–23 season, the Penguins unveiled their second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, this time featuring a black version of the white \"flying penguin\" uniform they wore from 1992 to 2002.\n[\n88\n]\nFor the\n2023 Winter Classic\n, the Penguins went with a vintage white uniform with black stripes, and added a gold \"P\" logo as a nod to the NHL Pirates of the late 1920s.\n[\n89\n]\nArenas\nThe Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to\nConsol Energy Center\n(now named PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two \"home\" games in the Cleveland suburb of\nRichfield, Ohio\n, in 1992 and 1993 at the\nRichfield Coliseum\n(this is not unlike the\nCleveland Cavaliers\nof the\nNBA\nplaying an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;\n[\n90\n]\nthe\nPhiladelphia 76ers\nused the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).\n[\n91\n]\nThe UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in\nCranberry Township, Pennsylvania\n, in April 2015. The complex opened in August 2015, and is used by the Penguins as their practice facility.\nFrom 1995 to 2015, the\nIceoPlex at Southpointe\nin the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility.\nRobert Morris University\n's\n84 Lumber Arena\nhas served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the\nBrantford Civic Centre\nin Brantford, Ontario, served as its home,\n[\n92\n]\nand by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban\nRostraver Ice Garden\nfor training.\nIn August 2015, the Penguins and the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\n(UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban\nCranberry Township\nnear the interchange between\nInterstate 79\nand\nPennsylvania Route 228\n.\n[\n93\n]\nThe twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.\n[\n94\n]\nAs with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a\ngoal horn\nwhenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by\nNathan Manufacturing, Inc.\nand introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and Consol Energy Center.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nMinor league affiliates\nThe Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in\nWilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania\n, since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the\nECHL\n, the\nWheeling Nailers\n, which they have been associated with since the start of the\n2000–01 ECHL season\n.\n[\n97\n]\nFanbase\nIceburgh, the mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins\nDespite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat.\nWhile the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical.\nJohn Steigerwald\n, brother of former Penguins broadcaster\nPaul Steigerwald\n,\n[\n98\n]\nnoted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at\nKDKA-TV\nfrom\nWTAE-TV\nin 1985, the station cared more about the\nPittsburgh Spirit\nof the\nMajor Indoor Soccer League\nthan the Penguins.\n[\n99\n]\nHowever, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade.\nToday, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three\nmajor professional sports teams\n, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field.\n[\n100\n]\nEspecially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of\nAndrew McCutchen\nand that team's turnaround)\n[\n101\n]\nranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.\n[\n102\n]\nIn the community\nThe\nPittsburgh Penguins Foundation\nconducts numerous community activities to support both youth and families through hockey education and charity assistance.\nSeason-by-season record\nMain article:\nList of Pittsburgh Penguins seasons\nSidney Crosby\nwith\nMarc-Andre Fleury\n(left) and the Stanley Cup during the Penguins' victory parade in 2009.\nThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Penguins.\n[\n103\n]\nNote:\nGP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\nSeason\nGP\nW\nL\nOTL\nPts\nGF\nGA\nFinish\nPlayoffs\n2020–21\n56\n37\n16\n3\n77\n196\n156\n1st, East\nLost in first round, 2–4 (\nIslanders\n)\n2021–22\n82\n46\n25\n11\n103\n272\n229\n3rd, Metropolitan\nLost in first round, 3–4 (\nRangers\n)\n2022–23\n82\n40\n31\n11\n91\n262\n264\n5th, Metropolitan\nDid not qualify\n2023–24\n82\n38\n32\n12\n88\n255\n251\n5th, Metropolitan\nDid not qualify\n2024–25\n82\n34\n36\n12\n80\n243\n293\n7th, Metropolitan\nDid not qualify\nPlayers and personnel\nCurrent roster\nview\ntalk\nedit\nUpdated April 20, 2025\n[\n104\n]\n[\n105\n]\nNo.\nNat\nPlayer\nPos\nS\n/\nG\nAge\nAcquired\nBirthplace\n55\nNoel Acciari\nC\n/\nRW\nR\n33\n2023\nJohnston, Rhode Island\n87\nSidney Crosby\n(\nC\n)\nC\nL\n37\n2005\nCole Harbour, Nova Scotia\n19\nConnor Dewar\nC\n/\nLW\nL\n25\n2025\nThe Pas, Manitoba\n27\nRyan Graves\nD\nL\n29\n2023\nYarmouth, Nova Scotia\n24\nMatt Grzelcyk\nD\nL\n31\n2024\nBoston, Massachusetts\n13\nKevin Hayes\nLW\n/\nC\nL\n33\n2024\nBoston, Massachusetts\n43\nDanton Heinen\nLW\nL\n29\n2025\nLangley, British Columbia\n14\nBokondji Imama\nLW\nL\n28\n2024\nMontreal, Quebec\n35\nTristan Jarry\nG\nL\n30\n2013\nSurrey, British Columbia\n73\nPierre-Olivier Joseph\nD\nL\n25\n2024\nLaval, Quebec\n65\nErik Karlsson\nD\nR\n34\n2023\nLandsbro, Sweden\n23\nVladislav Kolyachonok\nD\nL\n23\n2025\nMinsk, Belarus\n58\nKris Letang\n(\nA\n)\nD\nR\n38\n2005\nMontreal, Quebec\n46\nBlake Lizotte\nC\nL\n27\n2024\nLindstrom, Minnesota\n71\nEvgeni Malkin\n(\nA\n)\nC\nL\n38\n2004\nMagnitogorsk, Soviet Union\n2\nRutger McGroarty\nLW\nL\n21\n2024\nLincoln, Nebraska\n39\nAlex Nedeljkovic\nG\nL\n29\n2023\nParma, Ohio\n83\nMatt Nieto\nLW\nL\n32\n2023\nLong Beach, California\n18\nTommy Novak\nC\nL\n28\n2025\nRiver Falls, Wisconsin\n67\nRickard Rakell\nLW\nR\n32\n2022\nSundbyberg, Sweden\n17\nBryan Rust\nRW\nR\n33\n2010\nPontiac, Michigan\n5\nRyan Shea\nD\nL\n28\n2023\nMilton, Massachusetts\n20\nConor Timmins\nD\nR\n26\n2025\nSt. Catharines, Ontario\n53\nPhilip Tomasino\nRW\n/\nC\nR\n23\n2024\nMississauga, Ontario\nHonored members\nFurther information:\nList of Pittsburgh Penguins award winners\nRetired numbers\nThe banners of numbers retired by the Penguins franchise (pictured prior to the retirement of Jagr's jersey) hang in the rafters of\nPPG Paints Arena\n; prior to the Jagr ceremony, the banners were replaced with new ones that had Lemieux with gold numbers on a black background while Briere was given a blue background.\n[\n106\n]\nPittsburgh Penguins retired numbers\nNo.\nPlayer\nPosition\nCareer\nDate Of Retirement\n21\n[\n107\n]\nMichel Briere\nC\n1969–1970\nJanuary 5, 2001\n[A]\n66\n[\n108\n]\nMario Lemieux\nC\n1984\n–\n1997\n2000\n–\n2006\nNovember 19, 1997\n[B]\n68\n[\n109\n]\nJaromir Jagr\nRW\n1990\n–\n2001\nFebruary 18, 2024\nNotes\nA\nTaken out of circulation following Briere's death (1971), but not officially retired until January 5, 2001.\nB\nLemieux's number was restored when he resumed playing for the team on December 27, 2000, and once again retired on October 5, 2006.\nThe NHL retired\nWayne Gretzky\n's No. 99 for all its member teams at the\n2000 NHL All-Star Game\n.\n[\n110\n]\nHockey Hall of Fame\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins presently acknowledge an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in\nPennsylvania\n. The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153–98–30 record.\n[\n120\n]\nHowever, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the conference semifinals.\n[\n121\n]\nThe franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 division finals, 4–3; 1997 conference quarterfinals, 4–1; 2000 conference semifinals, 4–2; and 2012 conference quarterfinals, 4–2) and the Penguins winning three (2008 conference finals, 4–1; 2009 conference quarterfinals, 4–2; and 2018 first round, 4–2).\nWashington Capitals\nMain article:\nCapitals–Penguins rivalry\nAn altercation between the Penguins and the\nWashington Capitals\nduring the\n2009\nplayoffs.\nThe two teams have faced off 11 times in the playoffs, with the Penguins winning nine of the 11 matchups, their two series losses coming in the 1994 and 2018 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to their five Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. The NHL's fourth\nWinter Classic\n, played on January 1, 2011, at\nHeinz Field\nin Pittsburgh showcased this rivalry. The Capitals won the game 3–1. The rivalry can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the\nHershey Bears\n.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nMedia\nRadio\nFurther information:\nPittsburgh Penguins Radio Network\nThe Penguins have their radio home on\nWXDX-FM\nand their television home on\nSportsNet Pittsburgh\n. The\nPittsburgh Penguins Radio Network\nconsists of a total of 34 stations in four states.\n[\n125\n]\nTwenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in West Virginia, three in Ohio, and three in Maryland. The network also features an FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh.\nBroadcasters\nMain article:\nList of Pittsburgh Penguins broadcasters\nLocal ABC affiliate WTAE-TV broadcast the Penguins during the 1967–68 season, with station Sports Director\nEd Conway\nhandling the play-by-play during both the television and radio broadcasts. He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968–69 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969–70 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970–71 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970–71 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a\ncolor commentator\nto the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth.\n[\n126\n]\n[\n127\n]\nMike Lange\nserved as a play-by-play commentator for the team from 1974 until 2021.\nMike Lange\n, who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974–75 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979–80 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972–73. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984–85, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. \nWith Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman\nPeter Taglianetti\n. Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach\nRick Kehoe\nafter the 2002–03 season.\n[\n128\n]\nWith Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired\nBob Errey\nas their new color commentator for the start of the 2003–04 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005–06. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016–17 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016–17 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and\nNHL Network\npersonality\nSteve Mears\nwas hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017–18 season. Lange retired in the 2021 off-season, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement.\nPhil Bourque\nserves as the radio color commentator. Before the 2023–24 season, Getzoff moved to the television booth with Mears replacing him on the radio.\n[\n129\n]\n[\n130\n]\nThe Penguins did not retain TV analyst Bob Errey, choosing to go with a rotation of analysts featuring former Penguins\nColby Armstrong\n,\nMike Rupp\nand Phil Bourque.\n[\n131\n]\n[\n132\n]\nIn 2024, Joe Brand replaced Steve Mears on the radio booth after Mears was hired by the Blue Jackets.\n[\n133\n]\nEvery Penguins game is carried on the AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. On October 2, 2023, the network will be purchased by the Penguins and rebranded to\nSportsNet Pittsburgh\n.\n[\n134\n]\nIn addition,\nFox Sports Ohio\nsimulcasts Penguins hockey in the\nCleveland\nmetro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly \"game of the week\" national exposure on American networks\nESPN\n,\nESPN+\n,\nABC\n, and\nTNT\n, and Canadian networks\nSportsnet\nand\nCBC\n. Previously, the Penguins received national TV exposure on\nFox\n,\nNBC\nand\nNBCSN\nin the U.S., and\nTSN\nin Canada.\nIn-game announcers\nRyan Mill has been the Penguins' public address announcer since 2009 when he succeeded John Barbero. Jeff Jimerson has been the team's official anthem singer since 1991 and also served in the same capacity in the\nJean-Claude Van Damme\nmovie\nSudden Death\n.\nNotes\n^\nThe Penguins also recognize an affiliation with Hall of Famer\nRed Kelly\n, who served as the Penguins' head coach from 1969 to 1973. However, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the players' category in 1969, not its builder category, and had never played for the Penguins. However, the team continues to acknowledge an affiliation as a Penguins Hall of Famer.\n[\n111\n]\nReferences\n^\n\"Penguins Make The Move to 'Pittsburgh Gold'\n\"\n.\nPittsburghPenguins.com\n.
