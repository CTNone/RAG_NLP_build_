The Steelers compete in the\nNational Football League\n(NFL) as a member of the\nAmerican Football Conference\n(AFC)\nNorth\ndivision. Founded in\n1933\n, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.\n[\n6\n]\nIn contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-\nmerger\nNFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-\nmerger\n(modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe team is tied with the\nNew England Patriots\nfor the most\nSuper Bowl\ntitles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight\nAFC championships\n, tied with the\nDenver Broncos\n, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos,\nDallas Cowboys\n, and\nSan Francisco 49ers\nfor the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight.\nThe Steelers, whose history may be traced to a\nregional pro team that was established in the early 1920s\n, joined the NFL as the\nPittsburgh Pirates\non July 8, 1933. The team was owned by\nArt Rooney\nand took its original name from the\nbaseball team of the same name\n, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.\n[\n6\n]\nTo distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the\nRooneymen\n, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.\n[\n10\n]\nArt Rooney's son,\nDan Rooney\n, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son,\nArt Rooney II\n.\nThe Steelers enjoy a large, widespread\nfanbase\nnicknamed\nSteeler Nation\n.\n[\n11\n]\nThey currently play their home games at\nAcrisure Stadium\non Pittsburgh's\nNorth Side\nin the\nNorth Shore\nneighborhood, which also hosts the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\nPanthers\n. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced\nThree Rivers Stadium\n, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in\nPitt Stadium\nand at\nForbes Field\n.\nHistory\nFurther information:\nHistory of the Pittsburgh Steelers\nSee also:\nAmerican football in Western Pennsylvania\nRooney family era (1933–present)\nThe Steelers first took to the field as the\nPittsburgh Pirates\non September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the\nNew York Giants\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThrough the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (\n1936\n).\n[\n12\n]\nPittsburgh did make history in\n1938\nby signing\nByron White\n, a future\nJustice\nof the\nU.S. Supreme Court\n, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the\nDetroit Lions\n.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n13\n]\nPrior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.\n[\n14\n]\nDuring World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the\n1943 season\n, they merged with the\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nforming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \"\nSteagles\n\". This team went 5–4–1.\n[\n15\n]\nIn\n1944\n, they merged with the\nChicago Cardinals\nand were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\").\n[\n6\n]\nThis team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.\n[\n16\n]\nThe\nSteelers\nmade the playoffs for the first time in\n1947\n, tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n. This forced a\ntie-breaking playoff game\nat\nForbes Field\n, which the Steelers lost 21–0.\n[\n17\n]\nThat would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \"\nPlayoff Bowl\n\" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.\n[\n18\n]\nIn\n1970\n, the year they moved into\nThree Rivers Stadium\nand the year of the\nAFL–NFL merger\n, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed\nAmerican Football Conference\n(the others being the\nCleveland Browns\nand the\nBaltimore Colts\n), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.\n[\n19\n]\nThe Steelers also received a $3 million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.\n[\n20\n]\nChuck Noll years (1969–1991)\nHall of Fame\nquarterback\nTerry Bradshaw\nled the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s.\nThe Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach\nChuck Noll\nfrom the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the\n1969 season\n.\n[\n21\n]\nNoll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers\n\"Mean\" Joe Greene\nin\n1969\n,\nTerry Bradshaw\nand\nMel Blount\nin\n1970\n,\nJack Ham\nin\n1971\n,\nFranco Harris\nin\n1972\n,\n[\n22\n]\nand finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting four Hall of Famers in one draft year,\nLynn Swann\n,\nJack Lambert\n,\nJohn Stallworth\n, and\nMike Webster\n.\n[\n23\n]\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers'\n1974 draft\nwas their best ever; no other team has ever drafted four future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year.\n[\n24\n]\nThe players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four\nSuper Bowls\nin six years, as well as the first to win more than two.\n[\n25\n]\nThey also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins (\n1971\n–\n1979\n) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year.\nThe\nSteelers\nsuffered a rash of injuries in the\n1980 season\nand missed the playoffs with a 9–7 record.\n[\n26\n]\nThe\n1981 season\nwas no better, with an 8–8 showing.\n[\n27\n]\nThe team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. \"Mean\" Joe Greene retired after the\n1981 season\n, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after\n1982\n's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after\n1983\n's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after\n1984\n's AFC Championship Game appearance.\n[\n28\n]\nAfter those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in\n1985\n,\n1986\n, and\n1988\n. In\n1987\n, the year of the\nplayers' strike\n, the\nSteelers\nfinished with a record of 8–7, but missed the playoffs.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1989\n, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of\nMerrill Hoge\nand\nRod Woodson\nbefore narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons.\n[\n30\n]\nNoll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209–156–1.\n[\n31\n]\nBill Cowher years (1992–2006)\nIn 1992,\nChuck Noll\nretired and was succeeded by\nKansas City Chiefs\ndefensive coordinator\nBill Cowher\n, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of\nCrafton\n.\n[\n32\n]\nSteelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009\nCowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach\nPaul Brown\nof the\nCleveland Browns\n. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the\nAFC Championship Game\nthree times and following the\n1995 season\nan appearance in\nSuper Bowl XXX\non the strength of the \"Blitzburgh\" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the\nDallas Cowboys\nin Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling\nAFC Championship\nvictory over the\nIndianapolis Colts\n.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nCowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in\nSuper Bowl XL\nover the\nNFC\nchampion\nSeattle Seahawks\nten years later.\n[\n35\n]\nWith that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship.\nCowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.\n[\n36\n]\nMike Tomlin years (2007–present)\nRoethlisberger in a Steelers' throwback jersey during the team's 500th win in franchise history\nOn January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term \"retire\", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team.\n[\n37\n]\nA three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.\n[\n38\n]\nOn January 22, 2007,\nMinnesota Vikings\ndefensive coordinator\nMike Tomlin\nwas announced as Cowher's successor as head coach.\n[\n39\n]\nTomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history.\n[\n40\n]\nIn his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10–6 record and AFC North title.\n[\n41\n]\nThe team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season.\n[\n42\n]\nThe following year, he led the Steelers to a 12–4 mark and a division title.\n[\n43\n]\nWith wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship,\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\nTomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27–23 against the\nArizona Cardinals\n.\n[\n46\n]\nAt age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (\nTony Dungy\nwas the first).\n[\n47\n]\nIn their title defense, the Steelers went 9–7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season.\n[\n48\n]\nIn the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12–4 record and an AFC North title.\n[\n49\n]\nThe team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\nTomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to\nSuper Bowl XLV\non February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the\nGreen Bay Packers\n, 31–25.\n[\n52\n]\nIn the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12–4 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round.\n[\n53\n]\nThe Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the\nWashington Redskins\n.\n[\n54\n]\nOverall, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in 2012.\n[\n55\n]\nIn the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason.\n[\n56\n]\nIn the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record.\n[\n57\n]\nThey lost 30–17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Steelers finished with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season.\n[\n59\n]\nThey defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nIn the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record.\n[\n62\n]\nThey defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.\n[\n63\n]\n[\n64\n]\n[\n65\n]\nIn the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13–3 mark.\n[\n66\n]\nTheir postseason was short lived with a 45–42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n[\n67\n]\nDespite a 9–6–1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs.\n[\n68\n]\nThe Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season.\n[\n69\n]\nThe 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11–0 start.\n[\n70\n]\nHowever, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12–4.\n[\n71\n]\nThe team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48–37.\n[\n72\n]\nThe 2021 season saw the team go 9–7–1 and make the postseason.\n[\n73\n]\nThe Steelers lost 42–21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round.\n[\n74\n]\nLongtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season.\n[\n75\n]\nThrough the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162–94–2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013–17 seasons were noted for record performances from the \"\nKiller B's\n\". This trio consisted of\nAntonio Brown\n,\nBen Roethlisberger\nand\nLe'Veon Bell\n.\n[\n76\n]\nOccasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker\nChris Boswell\ndue to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.\n[\n77\n]\nPrior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.\n[\n78\n]\nPickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9–8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season.\n[\n79\n]\nIn the 2023 season, the team finished 10–7 and third in the AFC North.\n[\n80\n]\nThey made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31–17.\n[\n81\n]\nPrior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n[\n82\n]\nThe team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nSummary\nSince the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444–282–2 (.635) and an overall record of 480–305–2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.\n[\n85\n]\nOwnership\nArt Rooney II\n, controlling owner of the Steelers\nSince 2008, the\nRooney family\nhas brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations.\n[\n86\n]\nDan Rooney\n, and his son,\nArt Rooney II\n, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers – Timothy and Patrick – wanted to further pursue\nracetracks\nthat they own in Florida and New York.\n[\n87\n]\nSince 2006, many of the racetracks have added\nvideo slot machines\n, causing them to violate \"NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests\".\n[\n88\n]\nUpon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time:\nSeveral other members of the Rooney family, including\nArt Rooney Jr.\n, John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys.\nThe Robert A.

In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times.\n[\n94\n]\nIn the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8).\n[\n95\n]\nThe Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger.\n[\n96\n]\n[\n97\n]\nThe Steelers are 36–26 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger.\n[\n98\n]\nCivil rights advocacy\nThe franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with\nLowell Perry\n), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with\nJoe Gilliam\n),\n[\na\n]\nthe first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with\nFranco Harris\n), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with\nTony Dungy\n), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (\nAriko Iso\non July 24, 2002).\n[\n99\n]\nChampionships\nSuper Bowl championships\nSeason\nCoach\nSuper Bowl\nLocation\nOpponent\nScore\nRecord\n1974\nChuck Noll\nIX\nTulane Stadium\n(\nNew Orleans\n)\nMinnesota Vikings\n16–6\n10–3–1\n1975\nX\nOrange Bowl\n(\nMiami\n)\nDallas Cowboys\n21–17\n12–2\n1978\nXIII\nDallas Cowboys\n35–31\n14–2\n1979\nXIV\nRose Bowl\n(\nPasadena\n)\nLos Angeles Rams\n31–19\n12–4\n2005\nBill Cowher\nXL\nFord Field\n(\nDetroit\n)\nSeattle Seahawks\n21–10\n11–5\n2008\nMike Tomlin\nXLIII\nRaymond James Stadium\n(\nTampa\n)\nArizona Cardinals\n27–23\n13–3\nTotal Super Bowls won:\n6\nAFC championships\nSeason\nCoach\nLocation\nOpponent\nScore\n1974\nChuck Noll\nOakland-Alameda County Coliseum\n(\nOakland\n)\nOakland Raiders\n24–13\n1975\nThree Rivers Stadium\n(\nPittsburgh\n)\nOakland Raiders\n16–10\n1978\nHouston Oilers\n34–5\n1979\nHouston Oilers\n27–13\n1995\nBill Cowher\nIndianapolis Colts\n20–16\n2005\nInvesco Field at Mile High\n(\nDenver\n)\nDenver Broncos\n34–17\n2008\nMike Tomlin\nHeinz Field\n(Pittsburgh)\nBaltimore Ravens\n23–14\n2010\nNew York Jets\n24–19\nTotal AFC Championships won:\n8\nDivision championships\nThe Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949.

When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.\nYear\nCoach\nRecord\n1972\nChuck Noll\n11–3\n1974\n10–3–1\n1975\n12–2\n1976\n10–4\n1977\n9–5\n1978\n14–2\n1979\n12–4\n1983\n10–6\n1984\n9–7\n1992\nBill Cowher\n11–5\n1994\n12–4\n1995\n11–5\n1996\n10–6\n1997\n11–5\n2001\n13–3\n2002\n10–5–1\n2004\n15–1\n2007\nMike Tomlin\n10–6\n2008\n12–4\n2010\n12–4\n2014\n11–5\n2016\n11–5\n2017\n13–3\n2020\n12–4\nTotal Division Championships won:\n24\nLogo and uniforms\nFurther information:\nLogos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers\nA US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after\nthe merger\n.\nThe Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nand formed the \"\nSteagles\n\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the\nPittsburgh Pirates\nin baseball and the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the\ncity's official flag\n.\nThe Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \"\nSteelmark\n\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's\nU.S. Steel\nand now owned by the\nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute\n(AISI). In fact, it was\nCleveland\n-based\nRepublic Steel\nthat suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three\nastroids\n(\nhypocycloids\nof four\ncusps\n). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.\n[\n100\n]\nWhile the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.\nThe Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.\n[\n101\n]\nA year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.\nThe Steelers, along with the\nNew York Giants\n, are one of only two teams in the\nNational Football League\nto have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets.\nThe current uniform designs were introduced in\n1968\n. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the\n1970\nand\n1971\nseasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In\n1997\n, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (\nFutura Condensed\n) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.\nThe 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in\n2007\n. They were meant to evoke the memory of the\n1963\n–\n1964\nera uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.\nIn 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their\n1934 season\n. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.\n[\n102\n]\nAlso in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black\nColor Rush\nuniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants.\nIn 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.\n[\n103\n]\nIn 1979, the team owners were approached by then-\nIowa Hawkeyes\nHead Coach\nHayden Fry\nabout designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.\n[\n104\n]\nThree days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback\nTerry Bradshaw\n. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.\nRivals\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: (\nCleveland Browns\n,\nBaltimore Ravens\n, and\nCincinnati Bengals\n). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the\nLas Vegas Raiders\n,\nDallas Cowboys\n,\nDenver Broncos\n,\nNew England Patriots\n, and\nTennessee Titans\n. They also have an intrastate\nrivalry\nwith the\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.\n[\n105\n]\n[\n106\n]\n[\n107\n]\nDivisional rivals\nCleveland Browns\nMain article:\nBrowns–Steelers rivalry\nThe Steelers and\nCleveland Browns\nhave been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1;\n[\n108\n]\nThe Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach\nBill Cowher\ncoached the Browns special teams and secondary before following\nMarty Schottenheimer\nfor a brief tenure as\nKansas City Chiefs\ndefensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.\n[\n109\n]\n[\n110\n]\nBaltimore Ravens\nMain article:\nRavens–Steelers rivalry\nPittsburgh's rivalry with the\nBaltimore Ravens\nhas had several memorable matchups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at\nBaltimore's\nM&T Bank Stadium\nin\n1998\n, 20–13, and three years later the\nRavens\nhanded the Steelers their first-ever loss at\nHeinz Field\n, 13–10. Later that season (\n2001\n) Pittsburgh won a\ndivisional playoff game\n27–10 against Baltimore, who was the\ndefending Super Bowl champion\n. During their NFL championship season in\n2000\n, the Ravens defeated the Steelers\nin Pittsburgh\n, 16–0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9–6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32–24.\n[\n111\n]\nThe teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3–1 record.\n[\n112\n]\nCincinnati Bengals\nMain article:\nBengals–Steelers rivalry\nThe Steelers' rivalry with the\nCincinnati Bengals\ndates from the\n1970\nseason, when the\nAFL–NFL merger\nwas completed. In\n1976\n, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the\n2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game\n, in which the Steelers, en route to a\nSuper Bowl title\n, won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after\nBengals\nquarterback\nCarson Palmer\nwas forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle\nKimo von Oelhoffen\ncontacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.\n[\n113\n]\nThe Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the\n2005\nseason 38–31, and wide receiver\nT. J. Houshmandzadeh\nused a\nTerrible Towel\nto polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished\n2005\nand\n2006\nwith identical records (11–5 and 8–8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in\n2005\nand taking them out of contention in\n2006\n. The rivalry has become more intense again since the\n2015\nseason. A central figure is Bengals linebacker\nVontaze Burfict\n, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory.\n[\n60\n]\nThe Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35.\n[\n114\n]\nThe teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.\n[\n115\n]\nConference\nNew England Patriots\nMain article:\nPatriots–Steelers rivalry\nThe\nNew England Patriots\nemerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001\nAFC Championship Game\nat\nHeinz Field\n, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in\n1996\n28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in\n1997\n; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in\nTy Law\nand\nCurtis Martin\n. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival\nNew York Jets\n. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the\n2004 NFL season\n. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (\n1998\n–\n2007\n) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at\nFoxborough\nin\n2008\n, after\nMatt Cassel\nturned the ball over five times. The Patriots in\n2013\nthen made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16) and then won 36–17 in the 2016\nAFC Championship Game\n. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end\nJesse James\nwas controversially called back.\n[\n116\n]\nThough they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the\nLos Angeles Chargers\n(2–1), the\nJacksonville Jaguars\n(2–0), and the Denver Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots.\n[\n117\n]\nIn the\nBill Belichick\nera, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on\nSunday Night Football\n.\nTennessee Titans\nMain article:\nSteelers–Titans rivalry\nPittsburgh also has a\nrivalry\nwith the\nHouston Oilers/Tennessee Titans\nfranchise. The Oilers were aligned into the\nAFC Central\nwith the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34–31 playoff showdown in\n2002\n); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997–2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27–24 win at\nNissan Stadium\nin 2020.\n[\n118\n]\nDenver Broncos\nMain article:\nBroncos–Steelers rivalry\nThe\nDenver Broncos\nin 2011 broke a tie with the\nOakland Raiders\nfor the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from\n1970\n, but the first notable contest came in\n1973\n, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at\nThree Rivers Stadium\n, 23–13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35–35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34–21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33–10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in\nMile High Stadium\n; the Steelers pulled the upset 24–17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24–23.\nIn 1997, the two teams met in\nPittsburgh\nfor the\nAFC Championship Game\n, where Denver squeaked out at 24–21 win.\n[\n119\n]\nEight years later, the Steelers advanced to\nSuper Bowl XL\nby beating Denver 34–17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in\nSuper Bowl XLV\n, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as\nAFC Champions\ndashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the\nTim Tebow\n-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in\nPeyton Manning\n's\ndebut as Broncos quarterback\n. The two clubs met twice in\n2015\n, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs.\n[\n120\n]\nNeither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27–19.\nOakland Raiders\nMain article:\nRaiders–Steelers rivalry\nThe Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13–7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when\nTerry Bradshaw\nthrew a pass intended for\nJohn Fuqua\nthat was deflected into the hands of\nFranco Harris\n, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the\nImmaculate Reception\n, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.\n[\n121\n]\nThe victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33–14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in\n1974\n(24–13) and\n1975\n(16–10) to reach the\nSuper Bowl\n. The Raiders responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the\n1976\nAFC Championship game 24–7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before\nChuck Noll\nreferred to Raider\nGeorge Atkinson\nas part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on\nLynn Swann\nduring a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a\ndefamation of character\nlawsuit\nagainst Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38–10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback\nTerry Bradshaw\nwho did not play due to injury.\nWhile the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to the Raiders decline after\n2002\n), the teams have had notable games against each other, including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the\n2000\nseason to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the\n2006 NFL season\n(20–13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB\nBruce Gradkowski\n's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27–24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at\nPittsburgh\nin\n2010\n, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35–3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by\nRichard Seymour\nof the Raiders against Steelers quarterback\nBen Roethlisberger\n. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in\n2012\nand erased a 31–21 gap to win 34–31. The two clubs met again in\n2013\nand the Raiders won again, 21–18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38–35 at Heinz Field.\nOn December 9, 2018, in Oakland, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24–21, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.\n[\n122\n]\nThe Raiders won at Pittsburgh on September 19, 2021, 26–17, then fell on\nChristmas Eve\n2022 at Pittsburgh 13–10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback\nKenny Pickett\n. A lifeless performance in a 23–18 loss at Vegas on September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach\nJosh McDaniels\nand GM\nDave Ziegler\n. As of the 2024 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17–16.\n[\n123\n]\nInter Conference\nDallas Cowboys\nMain article:\nCowboys–Steelers rivalry\nThe Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the\nDallas Cowboys\n[\n124\n]\nstarted with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in\n1960\n(against the Steelers) at the\nCotton Bowl\nwith the Steelers coming away with a 35–28 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a\nSuper Bowl\n. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl\nSuper Bowl X\n21–17 and\nSuper Bowl XIII\n35–31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 – 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including\nErnie Stautner\n,\ndefensive coordinator\nfor the Cowboys who was a HoF\ndefensive tackle\nfor the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers'\nTerry Bradshaw\nand the Cowboys'\nRoger Staubach\n, both of whom are in the\nHall of Fame\n. In\n1977\n, Staubach and the Cowboys won\nSuper Bowl XII\n, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28–13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In\n1979\n, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14–3 en route to winning their\nfourth Super Bowl title\n. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in\n1996\n, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27–17. Dallas cornerback\nLarry Brown\nintercepted Pittsburgh quarterback\nNeil O'Donnell\ntwice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (\n2004\nand\n2008\n) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13–13, then\ncornerback\nDeshea Townsend\nreturned an intercepted pass from\nTony Romo\nfor the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27–24 margin in overtime and won 35–30 at\nHeinz Field\non November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–16.\n[\n125\n]\nThe Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film\nBlack Sunday\n, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24–19 margin.\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nMain article:\nEagles–Steelers rivalry\nThe\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nand Steelers are both located in\nPennsylvania\nand began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the\nCleveland Browns\nand\nBaltimore Colts\n) moved to the\nAmerican Football Conference\n, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the\nNational Football Conference\n. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2024 at Lincoln Financial Field, a game in which the Eagles won 27-13. The Steelers have lost 11 straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the\nSuper Bowl\nera.

Since 1994, the song \"\nHere We Go\n\" by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans.\n[\n133\n]\nSince 2002, the 1979\nStyx\nsong \"\nRenegade\n\" is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper\nWiz Khalifa\n, \"\nBlack and Yellow\n\", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience.\n[\n134\n]\nCheerleaders\nMain article:\nPittsburgh Steelerettes\nThe Steelers were the first NFL team to have a\ncheerleading\nsquad, they were known as the Steelerettes.

The most famous of these is probably\nMyron Cope\n, who served as a Steelers radio\ncolor commentator\nfor 35 seasons (\n1970\n–\n2004\n).\n[\n220\n]\nSeveral former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers.\nNewspaper\nThe\nSteelers Digest\nis the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n[\n221\n]\nIt has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.\nUsage in popular culture\nThe Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films:\nThe January 11, 1975, episode of the\nMary Tyler Moore Show\nfeatured\nSuper Bowl IX\n(featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.\n[\n222\n]\nBlack Sunday\nin 1977\n[\n223\n]\nHeaven Can Wait\nin 1978\n[\n224\n]\nSmokey and the Bandit II\nin 1980\n[\n225\n]\nFighting Back\nin 1980\n[\n226\n]\nHey Kid, Catch!\nin 1980\n[\n227\n]\n...All the Marbles\nin 1981\nEvening Shade\n(TV series) 1990–1994\n[\n228\n]\nThe Waterboy\ncameo by\nBill Cowher\nin 1998\n[\n229\n]\nThe Longest Yard\nin 2005\nThe Chief\na theater production.\nBlack and Yellow\nin 2010.\n[\n230\n]\nThe Dark Knight Rises\nin 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field\n[\n231\n]\n[\n232\n]\nMad Men's\nApril 14, 2013, episode has\nDon Draper\n,\nPete Campbell\nand\nRoger Sterling\nmeeting with two\nHJ Heinz\nexecutives.
