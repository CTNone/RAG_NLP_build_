I’m talking\nHeinz-obsessed\n,\nbuggy-using\n,\npierogi-loving\n, pop-drinking, black and gold-bleeding serious. So whenever someone asks me about the cuisine of the Steel City, I get incredibly excited.\nI’ll always explain the delicacies of\nchipped ham\n,\nstrawberry pretzel salad\n, and\nmy mom’s pierogi lasagna\n, but there are two dishes that are a staple for every Pittsburgher: a\nPittsburgh sandwich\nand the\nPittsburgh salad\n.\nI group the sandwich and salad together because they’re both made better (or, dare I say, perfect) by the addition of one special ingredient: french fries.\nThe new “perfect meal” might be a\nCaesar salad paired with a side of fries and martini\n, but we Pittsburghers have been taking it one step further by topping our greens with fries for decades—just swap that martini for an Iron City Beer.\nWhat Is Pittsburgh Salad?\nPittsburgh’s love for adding french fries to everything goes back to the Great Depression when\nJoe Primanti\nadded fries to his house-made sandwiches—topped with meat, tomatoes, provolone cheese, coleslaw, and fresh Italian bread. Thus, the “almost famous”\nPrimanti Brothers sandwich\nwas born.\nFrom there, the city became fry-obsessed—even opening The Potato Patch restaurant at the historic Kennywood Park that quite literally only sells fries doused in\ncheese sauce\nand bacon. While we can pinpoint the exact history of the Pittsburgh-style sandwich, the Pittsburgh salad has more unconfirmed lore surrounding it.\nTwo local restaurants—Jerry’s Curb Service and Hilltop Grill—claim to have created the Pittsburgh salad in the ‘60s. Originally, it was served as a\nsteak salad\n—with lettuce, cheese, chopped veggies, steak, and dressing—topped with fries, but, today, the Pittsburgh salad goes far beyond that.\nHow To Make Pittsburgh Salad\nNowadays, any salad can be a Pittsburgh salad just by adding fries. Local restaurants all across the city, like\nEat’n Park\nand Pamela’s Diner, offer Pittsburgh-style salads topped with steak, chicken, fish, deli meat, or egg—or the option to add fries to any existing salad on the menu. Basically, when in\nPittsburgh\n, you can always ask for fries to be added\nto\na meal and no one will ask any questions. It's when you ask for your salad or sandwich\nwithout\nthe fries that you might receive a weird look.\nIf you’re not in Pittsburgh, making the city’s iconic salad is just as easy. Just mix up your\nfavorite salad recipe\n—I recommend keeping it a little simple, like a salad you’d top with\nranch\nor Italian dressing—and add some fries. It’s traditional to use\nclassic, thicker fries\n, but crinkle-cut, shoestring, waffle, or any other favorite style of fry works too.\nThrow those crispy, warm potatoes on the salad, toss it up, and enjoy.
