Routes will continue to be monitored for overcrowding, and small service adjustments will be\nmade if warranted.\nSingle zone\nBy switching to a single zone system, Port Authority is able to offer one base fare, regardless of\ndistance traveled. This makes traveling more convenient; as riders will no longer have to worry about\npaying extra if they’re going from Zone 1 to Zone 2.\nPort Authority has had some of the highest average base fares in the country for the last several years,\nand we felt it was unsustainable and irresponsible to simply continue raising fares every few years. The\nproposal the Board is considering holds the line and, for about a quarter of our riders, reverses that\ntrend for the first time in at least 35 years.The economic makeup of our suburban riders is very similar to our inner-city ridership. This population,\nhowever, has had less frequent service and fewer routes to choose from which to choose despite paying\n150 percent more than riders traveling to and from Zone 1.\nAdditionally, a substantial percentage of our riders commute daily from within the city to the suburbs.\nThe flat fare will benefit those riders as well.\nPay on enter\nWith a pay-on-enter system, riders will no longer be confused as to when or where they must pay. Most\nriders will simply pay in the front and exit out the back. This will help with the flow of movement getting\non and off the bus.\nRiders who require use of the accessible ramp at the front of the bus may continue to do so.\nThe free Downtown bus zone will be eliminated due to the pay-on-enter system. The free\nDowntown/North Shore rail zone will remain.\nInternal data on passenger \"dwell time\" after 7 p.m. -- when buses are pay-on-enter Downtown -- show\na slight increase in boarding times for some of our highest-capacity routes, however, we expect an\noverall decrease in the amount of time buses spend waiting for passengers to board and alight.\nCash surcharge\nThe majority of our riders -- about 70 percent -- already pay with a ConnectCard, and we believe the 25\ncent cash surcharge and availability of electronic-only transfers will get more people using their\nConnectCard for the financial incentive.\nWe also believe this will solve complaints that riders who pay with cash slow down the boarding\nprocess.\nBetween the current and new ticket vending kiosks, even riders without ConnectCards will have access\nto buy ConnecTix for single trip tickets, thereby avoiding the cash surcharge.\nConnectCard fee\nWe propose charging $2 for ConnectCards to recoup the production costs. We don’t believe $2 is a\ngreat hindrance, as it can be recouped in just four round trips.\nThis fee will be charged for new and replacement cards, regardless of where it was purchased and\nwhether or not it is registered.\nFees will be waived for malfunctioning cards or cards that have been stolen, with a police report.\nTransfers\nTransfers will continue to cost $1 for ConnectCard users. Because paper transfers will be eliminated,\ncash users will pay full fare for each and every trip.Light Rail\nThe single-zone, flat fare and cash surcharge will apply to light rail on Jan. 1, 2017. Rail surcharges\nduring peak hours will be eliminated, also on Jan. 1, 2017.\nOnce additional ticket vending kiosks and payment validators are installed and the software is\nupgraded, riders at most stops will pay before boarding the light rail vehicle.\nRiders at low-platform stops will tap their ConnectCard upon boarding the light rail vehicle.\nOur technical support team is currently scouting locations for new ticket vending kiosks. Ideally, these\nkiosks would be placed at every stop along both the Blue Line and Red Line, but access to infrastructure\nmay make 100 percent coverage logistically impossible or financially impractical.\nExisting and new ticket vending kiosks will dispense both ConnectCards and ConnecTix. ConnectCards\nwill also be available through our website and mailed to customers.\nAfter additional payment validators and ticket vending kiosks are installed, some stations will feature\nspecially-marked areas where those inside will have already paid their fare.\nFare enforcement\nPort Authority will hire additional police officers who will, in part, check to make sure riders have paid\ntheir fare while in the “pay zones” or on board vehicles. Passengers will, at random, be required to show\nproof that they have paid while in these areas or on board.\nWe believe pay-on-enter and the cashless proof-of-payment method will reduce fare evasion and\ncontribute to higher revenue collection. Currently, fare evasion is currently at about 8 percent.\nFines for fare evasion are generally between $50 and $300, plus court costs. The only money Port\nAuthority receives is restitution for our loss, or the cost of the ride ($2.50).\nAdditional products\nPort Authority will offer a day pass for $7. If you know your rides for a day will cost more than $7, we\nsuggest buying a day pass.\nPort Authority is working with our software developer to roll out a Kids ConnectCard that will allow\nriders ages 6-11 to ride for a half fare. These cards, which will also cost $2, will be available at our\nDowntown Service Center, and like our other half-fare products, will require an application process.\nRiders under six will continue to ride for free.\nWe will also offer half-fare weekly and half-fare monthly products for eligible riders who have\nsuccessfully completed the application process.\nRiders who receive paper tickets through local agencies may instead receive single-trip ConnecTix,\nwhich work the same way and can be disposed of after alighting the vehicle."
