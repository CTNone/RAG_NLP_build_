    "08 Fall Fall 09 Saviors of Our Cities 2009 Survey of College University Civic Partnerships Dr. Evan S. Dobelle We st fie ld St at e C o lle ge, We st fie ld, M assac h u se t t sIntroduction Saviors of Our Cities Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships is an extension of Dr. Evan Dobelle s original survey and ranking of civically engaged colleges and universities that appeared in 2006. Civic Engagement, in this sense, refers to the positive economic, social, and cultural impact that institutions of higher education have upon the cities in which they reside. Results illustrate the broad range of engagement initiatives currently being implemented and are designed to analyze the evolution, maturation, and growing sophistication of these efforts which have proven so vital to metropolitan areas across the nation. Of note The final survey ranking does not include colleges and universities that reside in smaller, more traditional college towns like Chapel Hill, NC, Lawrence, KS or Bloomington, IN. At the same time, the ranking reflects institutional engagement impact to scale, meaning that the included institutions implement programs and initiatives that positively affect the greater part of their metropolitan areas.",
    "Circumstances and initiatives vary and the findings of this work document, publicize, and advance the unique and innovative means by which concerned and committed colleges and universities forge beneficial and permanent relationships with the communities in which they reside. The findings also make clear the widening sense of partnership among the institutions themselves, as they look to each other for guidance and support to advance the cause of civic engagement. Rankings They are meant to HIGHLIGHT programs, not to EXCLUDE programs, and we encourage the bringing to our attention of any unintentional oversights in our research at mkonig wsc.ma.edu. Methodology The format of this survey followed the original 10 assessment criteria developed by Dr. Dobelle for his 2006 work. These criteria are listed on a one-page document titled, Saviors of Our Cities Survey Criteria. Onsite interviews were conducted by a representative of Westfield State College with the presidents, directors of civic engagement or their designees from many of the institutions mentioned in this survey. While these interviews involved a fraction of the colleges and universities committed to civic engagement, they were strategically planned and designed to amass a significant amount of best-practice 2 Saviors of Our Citiesresearch material from many of the institutions recognized by Dr. Dobelle s 2006 survey.",
    "Interviews and evaluation of submitted materials required over a year to complete. The meetings took place on the campuses of these institutions and made possible a clear understanding of the unique qualities of engagement from institution to institution. The personal nature of the interviews also made apparent the growing sense of mutual support, which exists among these institutions. With the assistance and support of the American Council on Education (ACE), the Office of the President at Westfield State College sent both documents to the president s office of almost every college and university in the nation. Once the survey appeared, the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities (CUMU) graciously offered to include it on its website. This helped to ensure a broad institutional response. After assessing the responses, Dr. Dobelle, with the help of his Fellow, Dr. Michael Konig, Professor of History and an expert in social research, created this ranking of the Top 25 engaged institutions of higher learning in the country. They based the rankings on the qualitative and quantifiable responses to the survey criteria with a special emphasis placed on how effectively the engaged institution had forged a collaborative vision of a shared future with its community.",
    "An alphabetical listing of Honor Roll institutions is included as well. Special thanks are extended to those who gave of their time and resources to support this effort. Rankings 1.
