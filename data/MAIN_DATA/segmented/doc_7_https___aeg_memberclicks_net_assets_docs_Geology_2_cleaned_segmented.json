Infrastructure is significant in Pittsburgh. The City began and grew because of the natural river systems, sup- plemented by manmade canals. Today, the region has 23 navigation locks and dams.",
    "The early system of canals was later replaced by rail systems for the shipment of bulk com- modities. Allegheny County, the county encompassing Pitts- burgh, has more bridges than any other county in the Nation. In addition to bridges, the City has eleven tunnels that fa- cilitate vehicular transportation and two locally famous in- clines, which were originally used to transport workers up and down the steep topographic feature known locally as Mt. Washington. However, the existing infrastructure of roads, bridges, tunnels, railways and navigation locks and dams are aging. Today, Pittsburgh has transcended the legacy name, Steel City. Boasting a vibrant downtown, the City has na- tionally-recognized universities and medical centers. There is a resurgence in shale natural gas exploration using hydrof- racturing methods. Coal continues to be a dominant energy source for the numerous coal-fired power plants in the re- gion. Many environmental remediation projects are under- way in the region, related to acid mine drainage from legacy coal mining, reclaiming land areas of former steel mills, and past production sites of nuclear materials.",

    "The Paleo-Indians were hunter-gatherers who exploited the abundant animal and plant resources of the re- gion (Gardner, 1980). The Paleo-Indian culture was followed by the Archaic hunter-gatherer culture, probably between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, and the Archaic culture was supplanted by the Woodland culture about 3,000 years ago when agricul- ture was first introduced in the area. Two mound-building societies developed along the rivers and streams of this region during the Woodland cultural period. The first were the Adena mound-builders, who occupied the region from Figure 2.

A primary source in southwest Pennsylvania for land- slides is the Pittsburgh Red Beds, which is near the top of the Glenshaw Formation. It is a 40 to 60 foot series of mostly reddish, greenish, and grayish claystone and shale, with mi- nor amounts of sandstone and siltstone that tend to weather deeply on hillsides throughout southwestern Pennsylvania. Claystone is a low permeability, low strength rock with weakly connected pore space. Repeated weathering cycles and excessive pore pressure have a tendency to reduce the in- ternal shear strength of this particular rock, which can lead to failure. In addition, Conemaugh claystones contain minerals that tend to expand in the presence of water (Pomeroy, 1982). These red shales have been interpreted as a paleosol horizon (ancient soil zone) on the Pennsylvanian delta by Donahue and Rollins (1974).",
    "They suggest that the red col- or and the claystone texture are similar to that of a laterite soil weathering profile. Good exposures of the series can display evidence of an ancient soil development with some occasional root casts and calcite-rich nodules. Allegheny Group Pennsylvanian The Allegheny Group underlies the Conemaugh with a thickness between 270 and 330 feet in western Pennsylvania (Edmunds et al., 1999) beginning at the top of the Upper Free- port Coal and extending to the base of the Brookville Coal.

    "The Pottsville Formation consists predominately of a well-cemented cobble and pebble conglomerate with some sandstones and finer clastics and coal (Edmunds, 1999) that range in thickness from about 10 to 70 feet. It extends upward from the top of the Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation to the base of the underclay beneath the Brookville coal of the Allegheny Formation. Abrupt variations in the thickness of the Pottsville of up to 100 feet have been observed in short distances, with this variability mainly occurring in the basal part of the formation (McElroy, 2000). The formation has mi- nor marine limestones in northern Pennsylvania. Mining of coal in the Pottsville is limited. Because it contains resistant rock units, it tends to form ridges and cap most of the high- points, including Mount Davis (3,213 feet), the highest point in Pennsylvania, which is located in Somerset County.

    "Wisconsinian glaciation significantly altered the cours- es of the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers, and glacial outwash filled the valleys with sand and gravel. Erosion subsequent- ly removed approximately 80 feet of the sand and gravel, leaving about 50 feet of alluvium which created a significant aquifer in the river valleys. The alluvium consists of hard, dense sand and gravel which provides excellent foundation conditions for large buildings and heavy structures along with a high quality source of durable sand and gravel. Pittsburgh s Three Rivers Prior to the Pleistocene glaciation, which began approx- imately 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago, the Monongahela River was the dominant river in southwestern Pennsylvania (Figure 14). It flowed north to the site of Pittsburgh in a channel approximately coincident with its present channel. From Pittsburgh, it followed the channel of the present Ohio River to Beaver, PA where it turned north up the present Figure 13.

    "As the ponded wa- ters rose, they eventually crested and eroded notches in their drainage divides. The escaping waters formed new drainage channels that flowed southwestward, closely paralleling the front of the glaciers. The three Allegheny Rivers coalesced to form one, and the Ohio became the major stream of west- ern Pennsylvania, flowing south and then west along the boundary of the ice to the Mississippi River (Harper, 2002). The Allegheny and Ohio Rivers subsequently served as the major channels for the flow of glacial meltwaters. The relatively flat hilltops in the Pittsburgh areas are 500 to 600 feet above river levels. In Tertiary time, down- cutting of streams produced a system of broad valleys 350 to 400 feet below the hilltops and 200 feet above present river levels. This pre-glacial erosional stage produced valley levels known as the Parker Strath (a Scottish word meaning a wide flat valley) (Heyman, 1970). During the Illinoian stage of glaciation the ancestral Allegheny River was choked with glacial outwash, result- ing in the ponding of tributary streams. To the south, the Monongahela and Youghiogheny River basins alluvium is known as the Carmichaels Formation.",

During successive glaciations, this created a single, very wide valley at present-day Pittsburgh and left remnants of the old river valley floors 200 to 250 feet above the present river level.",
    "D. During the late (Wisconsinan) glaciation (about 75,000 to 10,000 years ago), the Allegheny River cut down a little more and filled the entire valley with glacially derived sand and gravel. Since that time, the river banks and downtown Pittsburgh have been covered only with locally- derived, nonglacial river sediment.

    "16Gray, Greene, Fandray, and Turka The average maximum thickness of the valley alluvium is about 60 feet. Normally, glacial sand and gravel consti- tutes the basal part of the alluvium and is overlain by recent flood plain deposits ranging in thickness from 0 to 25 feet. In parts of the present stream bed, the topmost member of the alluvium is a layer of very fine silt which, to some extent, is transitory and is probably scoured during floods and rede- posited as high water stages decline. Characteristic sections across the Allegheny and Ohio Valleys are shown in Figure 19. Laterally, these alluvial deposits extend the width of the pre-Wisconsinian stream valleys, which are wider than the present streams. Generally, the bedrock floor of the valleys is relatively flat, except in a few areas in the upper Ohio River where shallow channels were cut into the bedrock floor before the valley aggraded.

NATURAL RESOURCES Salt, Oil and Natural Gas Salt was an early high value mineral and was much sought after on the frontier. It was expensive to haul over the mountains from the east coast and therefore local sources were sought and established. It was originally obtained by evaporating naturally occurring saline brine discharges in springs in the area.",
    "The process was simple, settlers would dig holes and the holes would fill with brine which was col- lected and kettle-evaporated to obtain the crystalline salt residue. Later wells were drilled for salt, which frequently tapped the sandstones in the Pottsville Group which became known as salt sands. Figure 20.

Coal Pennsylvania is located at the northern end of the Appa- lachian Coal Basin. Coal beds underlie about 15,000 square miles of the State (See Figure 24). All significant coal beds in Pennsylvania are of Pennsylvanian or Permian age. Prior to any mining, Pennsylvania contained over 75 billion tons of bituminous coal and almost 23 billion tons of anthracite and semianthracite coal (Edmunds, 1999a). Early Coal Mining Coal was first mined commercially in the United States in 1745 near Richmond, Virginia. In 1760, British soldiers started mining the Pittsburgh Coal seam on Coal Hill (now Mt. Washington) across the Monongahela River from Fort Pitt (Figure 3). By 1800, only Pittsburgh and Richmond, Virginia were using coal to any extent for domestic purpos- es.",
    "In early 1807, a Mr. Cuming, traveling from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, upon reaching Greensburg, PA wrote On entering Habach s tavern, I was no little surprised to see a fine coal fire, and I was informed that coal is the princi- pal fuel of the country, fifty or sixty miles round Pittsburgh. It is laid down at the doors here for six cents a bushel. Figure 26. Example of Room and Pillar Mining (Eavenson, 1939) (Gray et al., 1974). In Pittsburgh, 10 collieries (e.g. a coal mine with con- nected coal-processing structures) were working in Coal Hill in 1837 (Eavenson, 1939) across the Monongahela River from the City. By 1865, coke produced from coal was increasingly important in iron processing (Gregory, 1980). There are few reports on coal and coke production before 1870 and no accurate records until 1885 (Eavenson, 1942). Mining Methods Room and pillar mining originated as a method of ex- tracting as much coal as possible while still providing roof control by means of coal pillars.",
    "During the 18th and 19th centuries, mines were small hand-excavated operations un- der shallow cover using hillside adits to enter the coal seam. Coal was cheap and the spacing, size, and regularity of pil- lars were somewhat arbitrary (Figure 25). Coal pillars were left in place as a matter of convenience and safety to the miners. Increased production by the mid- to late19th cen- tury brought mechanization and ventilation requirements to mines that necessitated a systematic arrangement of pillars, but still resulted in considerable coal being left underground. Mining often extended to where the overburden was only 25 feet thick. Early extraction ratios, the proportion of coal re- moved, averaged 30 to 40 percent. Since coal deposits were widespread and accessible, little effort was made to improve Figure 25.

The Pittsburgh Coal is of excellent quality overall and has been widely used for metallurgical grade coke. Except in northwestern Washington County and eastern Greene Coun- ty, its sulfur content is less than 2 percent (Socolow et al., 1980). Almost all production of the Pittsburgh Coal, past and present, is from underground mines. In the Pittsburgh area, the Upper Freeport Coal is the second most important bed in terms of mining and reserves.",

    "With railroads superseding canal barge transport, the obsolete South Fork Lake was sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later sold again to private interests. A group of notable Pitts- burgh businessmen, including coal and coke magnate Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Carnegie led a group to purchase the reservoir, modify it, and convert it into a private resort lake for wealthy industrialists of Pittsburgh. They built cot- tages and a clubhouse to create the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, an exclusive mountain retreat. Membership grew to include over 50 wealthy Pittsburgh steel, coal, and railroad industrialists. Changes to the lake, which was re- named Lake Conemaugh, included lowering the dam, which impounded the lake to make its top wide enough to hold a road, and putting a fish screen in the spillway, which unfor- tunately could also trap debris. These alterations increased the vulnerability of the dam to overtopping. Figure 35.

Sinkholes generally develop where the cover above a mine is relatively thin (Figure 41). Competent strata above the coal limit sinkhole development (Figure 40). Piggott and Eynon (1978) indicated that sinkhole development normally occurs where the interval to the ground surface is less than three to five times the thickness of the extracted seam, and that the maximum overburden interval is up to 10 times the thickness of the extracted seam. In western Pennsylvania, most sinkholes develop where the soil and rock above a mine are less than 50 feet thick (Bruhn et al., 1978).

The challenge for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was to build a larger lock chamber (84 feet by 720 feet) on the landward side of the older existing lock chamber (56 feet by 360 feet). Construction of a lock landward of an existing lock had only been attempted once before in the United States, in 1961, at General Joe Wheeler Lock and Dam on the Tennessee River in northern Alabama. Construction at the General Joe Wheeler Lock and Dam met with disaster when, during excavation for the new lock, the land wall of the existing lock slid into the excavation.",

Significant secondary natural gas recovery has resulted from physically improv- ing the permeability of the shale host rock through the pro- cess of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in conjunction with horizontal drilling (Figure 64). However, there is controver- sy concerning the volume, chemical additives and ultimate fate of fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) pro- cess. Some 6 to 10 million gallons of fresh water combined with surfactants, chemical additives, and propping sand are used to frack a single well, and to keep the induced fractures open to radially inward flow of formation gas.
