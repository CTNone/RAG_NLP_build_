    "Whenever a student-athlete is dropped off to begin their college career at our door step, we pledge to take care of them for the time that they are here, to help them reach their full athletic potential, grow into responsible citizens and to graduate from a great University with a meaningful degree. Now is a great time to be a Pitt Panther because of the support that we receive from Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, and our Athletic Director Steve Pederson. Our program is also benefi tted by the outstanding services provided by our Academic Support, Life Skills, Compliance and Busi- ness Offi ce staff s. The University of Pittsburgh is truly a team eff ort. Our Track and Field and Cross Country program has been built on a solid foundation that is the essence of Pittsburgh, a blue collar, sacrifi ce and no excuses accepted work ethic. I believe that those are the cornerstone of what is needed to be adhered to if we are eventually going to lead to success in everyday life. Eventually the Blue collar work ethic that we put in will turn into Gold.",
