The United States was in the midst of the Depression. Nazi Germany was gaining power throughout Europe. And in 1936, a very tense world turned its attention to Berlin and the Olympic games. That same year, a young man from Connellsville, Pennsylvania, arrived at the University of Pittsburgh destined to make history. As a freshman, John Woodruff immediately won gold at the Penn Re- lays and NCAA Championships. His amazing jour- ney had only just begun as he found himself as one of only 12 African-American members of the United States Olympic Team.",
    "Woodruff s incredible story continued over to the 800 meters, where he made one of the most in- credible moves ever seen in Olympic competition. He became the first African-American runner to win a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics. And had it not been for the World War II, he may have won many more. He entered the military in 1941 after graduating from Pitt with a degree in sociology in 1939. He also served during the Korean War. True to form, he spent his career in the service of others. His humble demeanor away from the track belied his dominance as an athlete on the track. While at Pitt he won three national collegiate championships, four IC4A championships and held the world record in the half-mile.
