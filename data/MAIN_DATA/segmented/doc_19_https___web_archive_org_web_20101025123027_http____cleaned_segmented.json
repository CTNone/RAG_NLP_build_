    "Three Reasons Why Pittsburgh Is Perfect for The Pittsburgh Summit 2009 Over the past 30 years, Pittsburgh has become a model for economic, environmental and quality-of-life transformation and has created a diverse, balanced and resilient economy driven by a people who have imagined a bright future and worked together to make it happen. Here are three keys to our success 1. Pittsburgh builds upon its historic strengths as a hub for manufacturing, finance, business services and energy. Advanced Manufacturing Pittsburgh manufacturers employ almost 100,000 workers and the region is the second-largest market in the United States for metals industry employment. Once the heart of steel production, Pittsburgh has become a global center of advanced manufacturing engineering, technologies and systems. The region is home to such global corporations as Alcoa, ATI, Bayer, Eaton, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, Koppers, LANXESS, Mylan, Nova Chemicals, H.J. Heinz, PPG Industries, United States Steel and Westinghouse Electric. Financial and Business Services Pittsburgh remains a leading financial center, with major institutions including BNY Mellon, Citizens Bank, Federated Investors, Highmark, and PNC headquartered or basing major business units here.",
    "In fact, financial activities represent the largest contributor to regional economic output. Two of the world s 15 largest law firms K L Gates and Reed Smith are headquartered in Pittsburgh, joined by a growing number of global law firms, including Jones Day. Energy With a legacy of leadership in energy innovation that dates back to the first commercial oil well in 1859 and continues through the development of the first natural gas well and pipeline and the nation s first commercial nuclear power plant, Pittsburgh provides an unparalleled mix of natural resources (including coal and natural gas), research and industry engaged in the development, production and distribution of sustainable energy solutions. Global Business More than 100, billion-dollar-plus global companies are either headquartered or base a major business unit in the Pittsburgh region. More than 300 foreign-owned companies have a presence in the region. 2. Pittsburgh leverages human capital to create new industries based on research, innovation and entrepreneurship. Health Care and Life Sciences Pittsburgh s health services sector has almost tripled in size since 1979, creating more than 100,000 jobs and building on a legacy of biomedical innovation to create a robust industry network that is cultivating life-saving technologies and advances in medical devices, regenerative medicine and pharmaceuticals.",
    "UPMC has grown into the region s largest employer and an 8 billion global health enterprise. Education and Research With two Tier-One research institutions Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh among our region s 35 colleges and universities, and with 100 corporate research and development centers, Pittsburgh has more than 70,000 workers engaged in research and development Information and Communications Technology The Pittsburgh region is home to about 1,600 technology firms including Ansys, Apple, Black Box, Google, Intel and Mastech, employing 32,000 people. These companies benefit from a tech-savvy talent pipeline and the support of organizations that nurture the region s growing knowledge-based economy. 3. Pittsburgh capitalizes on its natural and cultural assets to invest in infrastructure and facilities that improve our quality of life. Public-Private Partnerships Pittsburgh s innovative public-private partnerships, supported by a unusual concentration of philanthropic resources, have led the way in the development of air emissions control technologies, clean water systems, community improvement, outdoor recreation, and urban redevelopment. Arts and Culture Downtown Pittsburgh s Cultural District, once a blighted section of the city, sets the perfect stage for this Summit on economic recovery, standing as a unique international model of urban revitalization. Redevelopment of the Cultural District beginning with Heinz Hall in 1971 has spurred other development downtown and along the riverfronts. Going Green Pittsburgh is home to more than 30 LEED -certified green buildings, including the first green college residence hall and Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, which will host the welcome, opening reception and leaders dinner for the summit. The David L. Lawrence Convention Center, where the Summit will be held, is the world s first and largest gold LEED -certified convention center. And Phipps is building a new Center for Sustainable Landscapes, a Living Building, that will have a self- contained energy and water supply, a building that will exceed LEED -platinum."
