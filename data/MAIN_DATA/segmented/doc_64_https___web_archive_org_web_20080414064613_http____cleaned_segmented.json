The 2005-06 season brought changes to the Pitt wrestling program as it welcomed a new training facility located in the Fitzgerald Field House.

With one year of practice in the new facility, the Pitt wrestling program continues to thrive. Last year the team qualifi ed six wrestlers for the national tournament and had its fourth conference champion in three seasons.",
