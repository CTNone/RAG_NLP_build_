Vietnam-Japan University project\nIn 2006, the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians’ Friendship League (then President\nTsutomu Takebe) was inquired about human resource developments of Vietnam by H.E.\nPrime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, and the League was also requested to support the\nestablishment of a place of human resource training in participation of Japanese companies\nby H.E. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Thien Nhan (then Minister of Education and\nTraining). Then the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians’ Friendship League held a study under\nthe leadership of then Chairman Toshihiro Nikai (President of Japan-Vietnam\nParliamentarians’ Friendship League), and the League proposed the establishment of a\nuniversity and a human resource training center for the purpose of advancing training and\ntechnical skill, and of popularizing Japanese language education. In October 2006, Prime\nMinister Shinzou Abe and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung signed the Japan-Vietnam\nJoint Statement, in which the “Construction of Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park” was included as\none of the three main cooperation projects of Japanese Government.\nBased on a series of the above proceedings, the Vietnam-Japan University project (the\nVJU project) has been deliberated by Japan Vietnam Economic Forum (JVEF) based on\n“The Project to establish a university/graduate-school with global standards for aiming at its\nautonomously sustainable developments on the private market”, which will be principally\nconsidered to locate the University at Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park (HHTP) or at the scheduled\nrelocation site of Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-Hanoi) in Hoa-Lac. The Project\nhas been promoted under the support of the Leaders of Vietnamese Government and\nJapanese Government, and in association with VNU-Hanoi.\nCurrently, the VJU project has been promoted on the political leadership, gaining strong\nsupports and assistances from the Parliamentarians’ Friendship Leagues of both countries\nincluding H.E. President Toshihiro Nikai and H.E. President To Hyu Rua.\nAt JVEF, the Meeting of Japanese Universities was organized to deliberate the\nestablishment project of the University last year, getting participation of the prominent\nprofessors of leading Japanese Universities such as the University of Tokyo, Kyoto\nUniversity, Osaka University, University of Tsukuba, Nagoya University, Japan Advanced\nInstitute of Science and Technology, Waseda University, Ritsumeikan University, Kinki\nUniversity Takushoku University and so on (not-in-order). The meeting, which is co-chaired\nby Dr. Motoh Furuta, a professor of Tokyo University, and Dr. Michiaki Mishima,\nVice-President of Kyoto University, has been deliberating the organization, curriculums and\n4other detailed matters of VJU, on holding a series of discussions with VNU-Hanoi in VJU\nProject Taskforce.\nIn the beginning of 2013, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has started\n“Vietnam-Japan University Project Information Collection and Confirmation Survey” in order\nto analyze the accumulated basic information relating to the VJU project and to clarify\nproblems. JVEF has formed a consortium with related organizations to accept the survey.\nCurrently, the VJU project has been promoted well based on the inquiries of this survey.\nIn March of this year, JVEF established VJU Project Taskforce jointly with Vietnam\nNational University, Hanoi. The Taskforce is mainly composed of the eminent professors\nand experts of related Japanese universities and VNU-Hanoi. The Chairman of the\nJapanese side is Mr. Tsutomu Takebe, Honorary President of JVEF (current Special\nAdvisor of the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians’ Friendship League) and the Chairman of\nthe Vietnamese side is Prof. Dr. Mai Trong Nhuan, former President of VNU-Hanoi. The\nTaskforce has been executing the JICA survey smoothly and has been also coordinating\nvarious issues with the Governments and the universities both of Japan and Vietnam, and\nJapanese companies, taking into consideration of the surrounding situations such as the\nconstruction of Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park and the VNU relocation project.\nSince last March, Mr. Tsutomu Takebe, Special Advisor of Japan-Vietnam\nParliamentarians’ Friendship League, has hold serious discussions with the Leaders of\nVietnamese Government such as H.E. President Truong Tan San, H.E. Mr. To Hyu Rua\n(President of Vietnam-Japan Parliamentarians Friendship League), H.E. Deputy Prime\nMinister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, H.E. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Thien Nhan, and other\neminent Leaders. Their prominent Leaders have unanimously agreed quickly to establish\nVietnam-Japan University under the umbrella of VNU-Hanoi, and to build it as promised\nbefore at Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park. In addition, they have also promised to secure enough\nland to construct VJU.\nThis project draft has been summed up based on the proposals and considerations of the\nabove eminent people supporting the project.\n5(Reference) Vietnam-Japan University Project Taskforce (Established: March 11, 2013)\nVJU Taskforce, Japan\nVJU Taskforce, Vietnam\nVJU Meeting of Japanese Universities\n62. Outline of Vietnam-Japan University\n2. 1 Basic Principles\nVietnam-Japan University including the Graduate School has the basic principles to\ndevelop the people which will contribute to strengthen the relationship between Japan and\nVietnam as the base for Vietnamese developments and the mutual understanding of both\ncountries and it aims to be a leading university in Asia.\nThe basic principles of its establishment are in the followings.\n(1) To provide high-quality education capable to study in leading Japanese universities\n(2) To provide practical education based on Japanese technologies and experiences\n(3) To establish the university in accordance with the current cooperation of universities of\nboth countries\n(4) To respect for the initiatives of each university\n(5) To implement lectures and human resource trainings in Japanese Language principally\nas well as in English\nVJU will be established in the next ten years as the University with preparing both fields of\nnatural sciences and humanities such as (1) Science and Technology, (2) Medical Care,\nNursing Care and Medicine, (3) Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, (4) Japanology, (5) Law\nand (6) Economics and Management. VJU will be established as the University with 4 kinds\nof schools/faculties with graduate schools, which will be broadly grouped in order to be able\nto keep cross-sectional connections between advanced specializations. A lot of new\ncross-sectional research activities and the establishments of experimental and/or\nIndustry-academia collaboration institutions should be promoted in cooperation with various\nspecial courses of the University,\n72.2 Characteristics\nThe characteristics of VJU, in addition to the international level of education and research,\nwill be as in the followings.\n(1) To use Japanese Language principally as well as English in order to promote the\ninvitation of prominent Japanese professors and researchers in various special fields,\nand to make it possible for Vietnamese students to obtain their jobs smoothly in\nJapanese companies,\n(2) To integrate “education and research” and to emphasize collaborations and\ncooperation with companies in various fields such as industry-academia collaborations,\nresearch activities, lectures by companies and special human resource trainings,\n(3) To support students and researchers in their studying-abroad and in obtaining jobs from\nJapanese companies,\n(4) To employ/support Vietnamese students studied in Japan progressively,\n(5) To establish “Liberal Arts” (general basic education) and “community education” in\norder to develop advanced special fields creatively,\n(6) To implement advanced ICT educations such as interactive remote lectures/seminars.\n8These above characteristics will be consistent with the goals of the Vietnamese\n“Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2011-2020” which states “Education shall be a\nleading national policy・・・,・・・ for the purpose of upgrading the quality of human resources,\nthe comprehensive improvement of education and training, and the swift development of\nthe country. Especially, training of management executives, skilled specialists, business\nexecutives, scientists and skilled experts will be important.” In addition, the University will be\nconsistent with human resource needs of the Vietnamese developing society and of\nJapanese companies. Above all, the University will be indispensable to construct the\nbridgehead of Japan-Vietnam cooperation for the future in the globalizing world.\n2.3 Scope and Location\nVJU will have about 6,000 students including about 2,400 graduate students in the first\nten years, in which about 2,200 students will be in Natural Sciences and about 3,800\nstudents will be in Humanities and Social Sciences. Almost all students especially will take\nthe master’s courses of the graduate school. Following the Vietnamese state of the\neconomy, industries and the society, and the needs for those developments, the University\nwill train specialists and technical experts with highly qualified skills in a variety of fields, but\nthose details will be clarified in the coming research and in the future feasibility study.\nAt first, the University will hasten to construct the campus in Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park\n(HHTP). In the medium term, the campus in HHTP will be used for research laboratories,\nIndustry-academia collaborations and human resource trainings for specialists and the\ncampus in VNU will be used for education and basic researches. The campus of VJU will be\nabout 100 ha wide, and the site for the related activities such as research in laboratories,\nIndustry-academia collaboration and practical training of human resource will be about 100\nha wide.\nThe satellite campus of VJU should be established in the Hanoi central. It would be\nindispensable to manage the satellite and the main campus in Hoa-Lac totally.\nThe reason why the number of students will be relatively small compared with the big\ncampus is at first that the University should keep wide open environments enough to be\ndeveloped to the University like so-called Stanford Univ. or Harvard Univ. of Asia in the\nfuture. In addition, there will be a lot of plans to expand related activities including those of\nprivate companies such as establishing research laboratories, Industry-academia\ncollaborations and constructions of experimental facilities, and the additional space of the\ntraining programs of high qualified specialists and technical experts should be considered\nfrom now on.\n9Executives and specialists of private companies including Japanese companies mainly\nwill be invited to take roles of lecturers and specialists in the University.\n2.4 Facilities and Equipment\nRegarding facilities and equipment of the University, it will be necessary to prepare the\nexcellent environments, where prominent professors, business executives and leading\nspecialists around the world including Japan mainly, should be invited as lecturers/\nresearchers/heads-of-laboratories smoothly, and they should be able to hold various\nmeetings and seminars flexibly. As a leading university, VJU should indispensably have an\nadvanced e-library (24hours open), a communication center for researchers and students,\nan international conference hall, Industry-academia collaboration centers, all-weather\nathletic facilities (night open), excellent accommodations and hotels for the needs and\npurposes of visitors and students under the environments of an advanced ICT, energy\nsaving and affluent nature. It will be also so important to supply high quality services in\nJapanese style and to keep the excellent administration and the efficient management. It\nmeans to prepare the advanced services and facilities which executives and specialists of\nprivate companies in/around VJU could enjoy.\nPreparing the above facilities, equipment and related excellent services, VJU should\nsurely prepare good conditions for private companies including Japanese companies to\npromote their investments and locations in Hoa-Lac.\n102.5 Organization and Fund\nVJU will be scheduled to be established as a university under the umbrella of Vietnam\nNational University, Hanoi. The VJU secretariat’s function will be organized by a consortium\nof VNU-Hanoi, the participating Japanese Universities, JVEF and other related\norganizations. VJU will be financially expected to be self-supportive and the “maximum\nlevel of autonomy” should be provided for the administration and managements including\ncurriculum formations and personnel managements. Under the above conditions, a\npowerful secretariat should be set up for the efficient constructions and management.\nBasic capital assets for the construction and management of VJU will be composed of the\nODA fund prepared by Japanese Government and the land prepared by Vietnamese\nGovernment, and it should be additionally considered to seek for various financial sources\nsuch as financing of banks, donations and investments from companies and so on. For the\npurpose of the prompt constructions and the efficient management of the University,\nVietnam-Japan University Fund (VJU Fund, a tentative name) should be established, and\nVJU Fund would execute various supporting activities such as assignments of professors\nand lecturers to the University, planning and management of seminars and symposiums,\njob-searching for VJU students including students studying in Japan, promotion of\nindustry-academia collaboration, and efficient managements and constructions of the\nrelated services and facilities which should be totally designed .\n2.6 Construction Plan\nVJU would be scheduled to be established 3 years later as Vietnam-Japan Sustainability\nGraduate School (VJSS, tentative) at a temporary campus in the Hanoi central. Then the\nconstructions of facilities in the HHTP campus and the satellite campus should be also\nstarted and related activities such as the recruitment of professors and the trial courses of\nlectures will be also started.\nIn 6 to 7 years, VJU will hold lectures and research activities in the new campus buildings\nand the constructions of facilities and its activities will have been expanded continuously.\nThe University will promote various activities such as trainings of high qualified specialist\nand technical experts for the needs of Japanese companies, establishments of the faculties\nof VJU and industry-academia collaborations.\nChecking the constructions and the income-expenditure balance of VJU, VJU will\nstrengthen its constructions and related activities for aiming at establishment of the\nUniversity with 6000 students about 10 years later\nIt will be necessary to keep 3 Es’ factors as in the followings in order to realize the VJU\nproject.\n11(1) Excellent education and research of VJU, eminent professors and related\nresearchers/specialists supporting high quality, and good students,\n(2) Enough funds and assets such as ODA, land for the campus, financing of banks,\nvarious governments’ supports, private donations, corporate investments and other\nassets for excellent facilities/equipment and related good services, as well as support\nof VNU-Hanoi,\n(3) Effective market-based managements of VJU to maintain its sustainable\ndevelopment.\n3. Organization and Administration/Management of Vietnam-Japan University\n3.1 Organization\nVJU under the umbrella of VNU, will be scheduled to be developed to the University\nwhich will provide various courses of natural-science/humanities courses such as (1)\nScience and Technology, (2) Medical care, Nursing care, Medicine, (3) Agriculture, Forestry\nand Fishery, (4) Economics and Management, (5) Laws and (6) Japanology and Japanese\nlanguage in around 10 years. VJU will be also broadly grouped to about 4 schools or\nfaculties including the graduate schools. These schools/faculties will have the features such\nas the fostering of creative leading specialists mastered the general basic education course\n(the liberal arts) and the community-based educations accompanied with various club/circle\nactivities emphasizing human-growth and human-relations in the societies. The University\nwill be scheduled to be established in 3 years as Vietnam-Japan Sustainability Graduate\nSchool (a tentative name), and it will be developed step by step after its starting.\nVJU will mainly provide high-level education and research with the united programs for\nunder-graduates and post-graduates and will also have the training program of\nhigh-qualified specialists and technical experts. The organization and management of VJU\nwill be considered flexibly in accordance with various conditions such as various matters of\nVietnamese side, its budget and the placements of professors and lecturers.\nThe number of VJU students will be a total of approximately 6,000 students including\n2,400 post-graduates in about 10 years. VJU will have about 900 under-graduate students\nper school year, about 900 students per school year (2 years) for the master’s program (the\nfirst term of the doctoral course) and 200 students per school year for the doctoral program\n(the latter term of the doctoral course). There will be totally about 2,200 students in Natural\nSciences and about 3,800 students in Humanities and Social Sciences and almost all\nstudents will be scheduled to enter the master’s course of the graduate school. The training\nof highly qualified specialists and technical experts will be also considered specifically\n12according to the needs of the Vietnamese society and companies including Japanese\ncompanies in Vietnam.\nThe number of education/research staff for the above students, would be estimated to be\nabout 300 persons, 180 of whom in Natural Science, and 120 in Humanities and Social\nScience. Considering the staff for various research institutions and the diversification of the\nfields of education and research, the scale of staff would be probably expanded. Details of\nUniversity staff and students will be clarified in the coming survey and in the Feasibility\nStudy (FS). Their details should be also revised every year.\n(Table) Number of students of Vietnam-Japan University (Projected)\nNatural Science Humanities &Social Total\nScience (persons)\nUnder-Graduates 1200（300/year） 2400（600/year） 3600（900/year）\n(4 years）\nPost-Graduates 600（300/year） 1200（600/year） 1800（900/year）\n（Master, 2 years）\nPost-Graduates 420（140/year） 180（60/year） 600（200/year）\n（Doctor, 3 years）\nPost-Graduates 1020 1380 2400\nTotal\nTotal(persons) 2220（740/year） 3780 6000\n3.2 Administration and Management\nAs for the administration and management of VJU, the Japanese universities in charge of\nthe secretariat of the schools/faculties broadly grouped, will share the responsibilities with\nthe VJU secretariat under Japan-Vietnam Joint Council of VJU. The administration and\nmanagement of VJU should be established on the strong authority with the adequate\nautonomy (independence) of the University. Concerning common matters of all VJU or of\nseveral universities, it would be necessary for the VJU secretariat to take part in\ncoordination of those matters.\nThe secretariat of VJU should have the responsibilities for the total process of\nconstruction of VJU and should be in charge of the matters such as the formation of\nuniversity courses for under-graduates and for post-graduates, the fiscal plan, the formation\nand execution of the budget and coordination with VJU Fund.\nAs for the curriculum formations and the recruitment of professors and staff of the\nUniversity, those will be mostly treated by the Japanese universities in charge of the\nadministration and management or by VJU secretariat. In the cooperation and integrated\ndevelopments with VNU-Hanoi, VJU will promote the recruitment of Vietnamese staff\nincluding lecturers and management staff, and will train them for the purpose of shifting\nmost jobs of the University to Vietnamese as soon as possible. VJU will invite more\n13Japanese universities in Vietnam and other countries for participations and cooperation to\nthe project.\nThe fields established in VJU and the Japanese universities in charge of them will be\ntentatively assumed as in the followings.\n・Science and Technology: The University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Osaka University,\nThe University of Tsukuba, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,\nRitsumeikan University, Kinki University\n・Medical Science/Care, Nursing care, Medicine, Life Science: Osaka University, The\nUniversity of Tsukuba, Nagoya University, Kinki University, Ritsumeikan University, (Kyoto\nUniversity)\n・Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery: Kinki University, ・・・\n・Economics, Business and Management (including Policy Science and Public Policy):\nOsaka University, Kinki University, Ritsumeikan University, Kaetsu University\n・Law: Nagoya University\n・Japanology and Japanese Language: The University of Tokyo, The University of Tsukuba,\nWaseda University, Takushoku University\n3.3 Training of Highly Qualified Specialists and Technical Experts\nVietnam-Japan University will train highly qualified specialists and technical experts\nespecially for the needs of Vietnamese students/societies and Japanese companies. The\nUniversity will also support students to find their jobs in Japanese companies and to study\nin Japan continuously.\nBesides providing practical education and training, VJU will train a lot of Vietnamese\nbusiness people such as entrepreneurs of small/medium sized companies, highly qualified\ntechnical experts in the fields of infrastructure constructions and managing executives of\nJapanese companies in association with the existing human resource training programs. It\nwill be also taken into consideration to establish “The College of Technology” with the\nexisting similar activities.\nVJU will also develop human resources for new businesses such as M&A support\nservices for fostering entrepreneurs and specialists.\n3.4 Promotion of Industry-academia collaboration and Encouragement of Private\nInvestments\nIn addition to widely-ranged practical education-and-research activities, VJU will be\nactively promote Industry-academia collaboration and will surely welcome various\ninvestments of private companies including Japanese companies for the purpose of (1)\nsecuring good employments for students and researchers, (2) Enhancement of the\n14qualities of university’s research activities through promoting joint researches with private\ncompanies, (3) Strengthening practical education through receiving executives of\ncompanies and qualified specialists as lecturers, and (4) Keeping important sources of\nincome such as direct supports of companies and their investments. Therefore VJU will\nactively provide related services in the occasions of acceptances of the investments and\nrelevant human resources of companies.\nThe advantages for Japanese companies in the cases such as the locations of research\nfacilities, will be of (1) High living environments and excellent locations, (2) Comfortable\nliving/education/business environments of using Japanese language, (3) Advantages taking\nthe relevant services of human resource trainings of Japanese language, Japanese culture\nand other practical specific sectors, (4) Trainings of highly qualified specialists and technical\nexperts, (5) Favorable image for the companies cooperating in human resource trainings in\nVietnam, (6) Reduction of investment risks (in the cases of those starting and retreatment,\ngathering of information and various managements), (7) Acquisition of information\nconcerning various researches and developments in Vietnam, (8) Contribution to the\nVJU/VNU activities such as the lecture-hosting, the acceptance of interns, and joint\nresearches.\n4. Characteristics of the Education and Research of Vietnam-Japan University\n4.1 Basic Principles of the Education and Research\nVJU should develop creative human resource leading our society as an advanced\nuniversity with international standards, and for the purpose of further developments of\ncooperation of Japan and Vietnam, each field of VJU should also have various practical\nroles such as (1) The role of “Science Technology and Engineering” and “Agriculture,\nForestry and Fishery” will be to foster students for highly qualified specialists and technical\nexperts and business executives and managers of companies and organizations, (2) The\nrole of “Medical Science/Care, Nursing Care, Medicine, Life Science” will provide integrated\ntraining including practical trainings for highly qualified specialists, (3) The role of\n“Economics, Business and Management” will be to foster students for qualified specialists\nconcerning economics and public policies, and for leading business persons such as\nentrepreneurs, senior executives of companies, financial experts and so on, and (4) The\nrole of Japanology and Japanese language will be to train students for leading specialists to\npromote cultural exchange/developments of both countries as well as the education of\nJapanese language.\nThe education and research of VJU should be integrated to ensure a high level of\n15education with international standards. The University will have the curriculums founded on\nthe practical education and research keeping strong ties with our societies. The\ncharacteristics of the curriculum will be as in the followings: (1) Highly creative human\nresource developments founded on liberal arts (general basic education) required in special\nstudies, (2) Hosting practical and attractive lectures and seminars of prominent professors\nand business executives, (3) Community-forming education and research based on human\nrelations, (4) Service offering to meet various needs through the functional human network\nbetween the relevant Universities, (5) Japanese-style human resource trainings such as\nsocial basic training, human-relations and communication, and supports for job-placements,\n(6) Development of educational environments of Japanese language, (7) Promotion of the\neducation-in-English and the global education, (8) Establishment of the leading\nenvironment of education and research with advanced ICT (Information Communication\nTechnology) .\nFor the purpose of ensuring the creative environments responding flexibly to various\nissues in the changing society/economy, it would be so important for the development of the\nUniversity whether its schools/faculties could create cross-sectional cooperation such as\nestablishments of joint laboratories and institutions, evading sectionalism and isolationism,\nand whether the “The Common Identity of the University” including various factors could be\nestablished.\n4.2 Characteristics of the Education and Research\n(1) Importance of the Liberal Arts (General Basic Education)\nIn order to realize the broad high-level liberal arts (general basic education) supporting\ndevelopments of advanced education in special fields, and to train human resource to\nrespond creatively and flexibly to various issues of our society and economy, the liberal arts\ncourses (general basic education such as history, society/culture/legal systems, information\nprocessing/statistics, management, policy science) are very important in the University.\n(2) Holding of Practical and Attractive Seminars and Courses by Prominent Professors and\nBusiness Executives\nVJU will promote to accept the research-and-development investments and the prior\ninvestments of companies as well as the establishments of the research institutions and the\nlaboratories in association with companies. For this purpose, relay lectures and seminars of\nprominent professors and senior executives of leading companies visiting Vietnam will be\nheld frequently. VJU will hold the titled-courses/donated-courses of companies and\nstudents in Vietnam will be able to take remote-lectures held in Japan with advanced ICT. In\naddition, for the lectures which would not be able to hold in Hanoi due to scheduling of\n16lecturers and to some difficulties of equipment installments, the network of each Japanese\nUniversities will be establish to meet the broad needs by preparing intensive courses as\nwell as studying in Japan.\n(3) Community-forming Education and Research based on Human Relations\nVJU will actively provide students direct guidance by the professors or the supervisors as\nwell as supports for job-searching or career guidance. In addition, the University will\nencourage extra-curricular club and circle activities of sports and cultures, and will make\nstudents create “Sense-of-Responsibilities to our society” and “Abilities to\nParticipation-and-Contributions to their communities”.\n(4) Service-Offering to meet Various Needs by the Functional Human Network of the\nJapanese Universities\nVJU, accepting financial contributions and supports from Japanese companies and the\nassistance and participation of leading Japanese Universities, will engage in promotion of\nindustry-academia collaboration and in training of highly qualified human resource. Taking\nuse of the internship system and Industry-academia collaboration through the networks,\nVJU will offer students good career-guidance and supports for job-searching.\n(5) Japanese-style Human Resource Trainings such as Social Basic Training,\nHuman-Relations and Communication, and Supports for Job-Searching\nVJU will develop human resource in a Japanese style, while paying attentions to global\nfactors, and will promote for students to secure jobs at Japanese companies smoothly.\nEven after their graduation, the University will prepare the opportunities for development of\ntheir abilities to continue their studies and researches in the graduate school, and to provide\nsupports for job-searching continuously.\n(6) Development of Educational Environments of Japanese Language\nVJU will fortify the educational environments of Japanese language thoroughly. When\nstudents could master Japanese language, they would be able to get qualifications to study\nin Japan and would be so smooth to get employments. The University will create favorable\nenvironments efficiently to learn Japanese language for Vietnamese and to learn\nVietnamese language for Japanese. The University will provide opportunities for people\nto learn Japanese at reasonable charges, for example as the implementation of a certifying\nexamination of Japanese Language.\n(7) Promotion of Education in English and the Global Education\nFor Vietnamese needs for the Globalization, VJU will prepare a lot of English lectures and\na series of global events, for example, as a key center of the Asian area. The University will\nprovide bridges for Japanese students and companies’ trainees to study in Vietnam.\n17English will be used in the global fields of Science and Technology, and Both of Japanese\nand English will be used in the fields of industry-academia collaboration with Japanese\ncompanies. Japanese should be used in the fields of Laws and other broad fields where\nvarious Japanese Specialists and Technical Experts will be considered to have main roles,\nand supposedly among a majority of various business specialists and technical experts for\neffective communications and further developments of cooperation of both countries.\n(8) Establishment of the Advanced Environments of Education and Research with ICT\n(Information Communication Technology) and relevant facilities\nThe University area should be constructed as the advanced demonstration area of\neducation-and-research/living environments for the next generation. VJU will prepare\ncomfortable living environments for people with plenty of “green-and-water”,\n“safety-and-security”, “friendly-kindness for children, elder people and foreign visitors” as\nwell as the advanced Information Communication Technology.\n4.3 Education and Research by Each Grade\nIt will be basically assumed that almost all students of VJU will study up to the master’s\ncourse (the first term of the doctoral course).\nIn the first two years’ grades of undergraduates, the courses of the University will be\nmainly consisted of basic ones such as learning Japanese education thoroughly, and liberal\narts including in Vietnamese. The students who will have required language skills will be\npermitted to take special courses. English lessons will be also implemented actively. The\nstudies of general basic subjects will be indispensable to foster creativities in special fields,\nand in addition, cross-sectional human communications and various community-activities\nbefore entering special fields, will create important opportunities for developments of\nstudies and researches in special fields.\nIn the third-and-fourth years’ grades of undergraduates, students will study in Japanese\nand English (the language used would be decided by the course) and a part of students\nmay go to study in Japan. As it will be necessary to keep various curriculums and to carry\nout lectures and seminars efficiently, we will construct an advanced ICT network strongly\nconnected with Japanese Universities, and will create the University-Community in such\nways as providing with a lot of opportunities of communication by holding remote\nstudies/lectures/forums/seminars in various places. As for the languages-used-in-lectures\n(Japanese or English), those level will depend on the courses selected by students, but it\nwould be commonly requested to learn Japanese-used-daily at least. In any case, students\nwould be necessary to be supported by some auxiliary means to get a certain level of\nlanguage skills. For setting up Japanese language courses, the supports and cooperation\n18of VNU-Hanoi including other eminent Vietnamese universities might be indispensable.\nVJU will be scheduled to start the graduate school with the master’s course (the first term,\n2 years, of the doctoral course). For the developments of advanced research in special\nfields and the implementations of high-level liberal arts education supporting them, the\nstudents of 1st grade of the master’s course, would be asked to learn “international liberal\narts” courses principally. For the doctoral program, which will be the 3-year-program\nfollowing the master’s course, VJU would consider to respond by combining study-in-Japan\nprograms and joint-degree systems and by other ways for the time being. VJU would haste\nto establish a full graduate school as soon as possible anyway.\n5. Location and Facilities of Vietnam-Japan University\n5.1 Location\nVJU would be scheduled to be established at Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park (HHTP) and at the\nrelocation site of Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-Hanoi) in Hanoi. The University\nshould be developed to a leading one in the world in cooperation with VNU-Hanoi. To be a\nleading one, VJU should be in the advanced favorable environments where a lot of\nsurrounding organizations such as laboratories of companies, institutions of\nIndustry-academia collaboration, and organizations of highly qualified human resource\ndevelopment, would be located, and where a lot of relevant investments would be realized\nby them. In addition, VJU should establish the attractive environments for people such as\n(1) the broad and open campus with a lot of green-and–water, (2) the comfortable living\nenvironment for children, seniors and foreigners, (3) securing of security and safety, (4)\nsegregation between people and cars, (5) “barrier-free” for handicapped people, and\nshould be able to invite prominent professors, senior executives of companies, various\nleading specialists and so on, and then a lot of leading companies including Japanese\ncompanies would most probably increase related investments in Hoa lac and in the\nsurrounding areas.\nThe campus of VJU should be expected to be totally about 100 ha in about 10 years.\nFurthermore, since the University will be planning to establish research institutions and\nrelevant facilities under industry-academia collaboration, to practice practical human\nresource trainings in various fields and to accept a lot of investments of private companies.\nTherefore it would be necessary to secure around 200 ha including the above sites.\nIn addition, the satellite campus (of about 2~5 ha), should be constructed in the Hanoi\ncentral to complement the remoteness of Hoa-Lac campus (30 km west of the Hanoi\ncentral). Connecting between Hoa-Lac and the Hanoi central by rapid-and-reliable shuttle\n19bus service, we might expect the Hoa-Lac Campus to be so near to the Hanoi central (Note).\nThe satellite campus, which should be a Japanese cultural exchange center, would also\nmake an important role as the gateway-to-Hoa-Lac, in which offices of the Japanese\nUniversities, Japanese companies and relevant organizations, accommodations and hotels\nfor long term residents would be located.\n(Note) The commuting time between the satellite campus and the Hoa-Lac campus\nshould be under 30 minutes.\n5.2 Buildings/Facilities and Surrounding Environments\nConcerning VJU buildings/facilities and related services, for the purpose of the\nconstruction of an advanced attractive campus, VJU, paying attentions to an advanced ICT,\nenergy-saving and environment-protections, should construct various buildings and\nfacilities such as a E-Library (operating for 24 hours), a Communication Center for students\n(a place for various social interactions: Japanese/Vietnamese restaurants/dining-rooms,\ncommunication areas, small/medium sized event halls, etc.), a University Hall (an\nauditorium, big rooms for large events, etc.), a Science and Technology Museum (for the\npurpose of fostering the youth dream for manufacturing and of fostering youth interest in\nScience and Technology), a Industry-and-Manufacturing Museum (a showcase of the\n20back-ground of Japanese Manufacturing Power, introduction of the roles of various\nSmall-and-Medium-sized Companies, Industry-Academia Collaborations, etc.), an\nadvanced ICT, surrounding environments (Broad open spaces, Parks with plants, “flowers\nand water “(Japanese garden, etc.)), Playgrounds and a Sports-Center (open at night and\nin all weather), Welfare Facilities and Accommodations.\nShort-and-long-term accommodations/hotels will also be required for the Universities’\nstaff including researchers, specialists, technical experts, students and so on.\nThe high-quality administration such as safety-and-security, friendly area for seniors,\nchildren and travelers, an area for human-beings, and the efficient management should be\nprovided.\nFor establishments of companies’ research institutes by industry-academia collaboration,\nrelevant investments, sponsorships and others, it would be necessary to prepare effective\nfacilities to receive those investments.\nVNU-Hanoi is planning to carry out a series of infrastructure constructions at the VNU\nrelocation site by methods such as PPP, BOT and others with the Construction Ministry, and\nthe details of its schedule and contents should be confirmed successively and to be\nprogressively coordinated with each other in order to ensure the efficient constructions of\nVJU.\nThe surrounding environments of VJU would be also so important that those factors\nwould be as in the followings.\n(1) The campus of the University should not be enclosed with fences and the security\ninside the buildings should be secured.\n(2) The campus should be covered so plenty of flowers and trees as to feel the change\nof Hanoi’s four seasons in the nature.\n(3) Comfortable Japanese gardens with ponds should be located putting lotus flowers\nof both Japanese and Vietnamese as a symbol.\n(4) People and vehicles should be separated clearly and the space for people should\nbe barrier-free.\n(5) Enough space should be provided for people to exercise and to refresh themselves\neven in bad weather\n(6) The campus should be resistant to various disasters such as floods and storms.\n(7) The space for children should be provided appropriately.\n(8) Facilities and Equipment of various sports should be provided.\n(9) The reliable, rapid and safe transportation system to/from the Hanoi central should\nbe established.\n21(10) People should be able to communicate in Vietnamese, Japanese and English.\n5.3 Campus and Facilities\nAs to the land of VJU for buildings, facilities and related properties, whose scale would be\naffected by its location, shape and surrounding environments, it should be secured as in the\nfollowings.\n(1) In HHTP (Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park), 60 ha and more of land would be expected to be\nsecured: 20ha of land for the university use (later the space would be diverted\nadditionally to the use for Industry-academia collaboration), 20 ha of land for\nIndustry-academia collaboration, human resource training lands, establishments of\ncompanies’ research institutes and other relevant private investments, and 20 ha of\nland for sports ground, parking lots and others\n(2) In the VNU relocation site, 60 ha and more of land would be expected to be secured:\n30 ha of land for the building and facilities for the purpose of the education and\nresearch of the University, 20 ha of land for sports ground and parks, 10ha of land for\nparking lots and others.\n(3) In the satellite campus of the Hanoi central, 2 to 5 ha of land would be expected to be\nsecured.\nMore details will be clarified in the result of the coming survey (and in the FS survey\nalso) based on more opinions of related people, specific needs of companies, students\nand more relevant organizations.\n22(Table) Buildings, Facilities and other Properties of Vietnam-Japan University\nSizes of Floors(㎡) and (Lands（ha）)\nItems ＨＨＴＰ（＊） ＶＮＵ（＊） The

Administration, Management and Finance of Vietnam-Japan University\n6.1 Administration/Management and Finance of the Establishment Cost\nThe Administration and Management of Vietnam-Japan University will be promoted by\nthe VJU Secretariat and the Japanese Universities which will have the responsibilities for\nsome parts of the University curriculum under the University Council composed of both\ncountries. The University will be under the umbrella of VNU-Hanoi, but should be\nindependently managed to keep its fiscal sustainability in the market over a long period of\ntime. Therefore, the University should secure broad option in its administration and\nmanagement based on the “autonomy” in the areas of “education, scientific and\ntechnological surveys/research, organizational structure, use of funds and international\nrelations”, and additionally in regards to personnel managements, financing, highly qualified\nhuman resource training and hosting of various events and so on.\nThe fund for the establishment and starting of VJU will be estimated to amount to around\n○○ billion yen. It will be (1) ○○ billion yen to the construction of the buildings and facilities and\nto the developments of surrounding environments, (2) ○○ billion yen to the current expenses\nfor the management and operation of the University in total for the first 6 to 7 years, (3) ○\nbillion yen to the training of the University staff and to the supports of students in total for the\nfirst 6 to 7 years. Considering the scale of the University, only the construction costs of the\nbuildings and facilities over a projected period of 10 years will be estimated to amount to\nbetween 30 and 40 billion yen. After the starting of the University, it would take 3 to 4 years\nto get a proper prospect for its sustainable development keeping the constructions of the\nbuildings and facilities. In the meantime, VJU should make a clearer outlook of the\nincome-and-expenditure balance, and should seek for a proper path to the target of the\nconstructions, judging from various conditions such as the land for the University, the\nsupports/investments of private companies and the development of surrounding\ninvestments.\nThe income-and-expenditure balance of the University will be so affected by the\nsituations of the broadness of the land acquired, the developments of industry-academia\ncollaboration, and the supports and investments of private companies that the University\nshould promote its constructions by active securing of income, expansion of supporters and\npositive acceptance of private investments.\n6.2 Vietnam-Japan University Fund\nTo support the construction of Vietnam-Japan University and to promote the sustainable\ndevelopment and smooth running of its activities, the establishment of the Vietnam-Japan\nUniversity fund (hereinafter referred to as VJU Fund) will be proposed. VJU Fund would be\n24considered to be established as a NPO (non-profit organization) or a SPC (Special Purpose\nCompany). VJU Fund and Vietnam-Japan University, which will sign a cooperation\nagreement, will support the constructions and current running of VJU, as well as the training\nof highly qualified specialists and technical experts, the promotion of industry-academia\ncollaboration, the construction of laboratories, the securing of supports and investments of\nprivate companies and related services. The University might be imposed various\ninstitutional restrictions on its activities, so we would propose to set up the Fund.\nVJU Fund will fundamentally have the Board, the Supervisor (a leader, CEO) and the\nSecretariat. The Board will consist of the members such as the core members of VJU\nCouncil and investors of both countries, while the Secretariat will be consisted by the staff of\nboth countries depending on their investments. A powerful decision-making body should be\nestablished to ensure the smooth progress of the construction and developments of the\nUniversity.\nVJU Fund should not be a permanent entity and, at the final stage of the University\nconstruction plan, the related businesses will be separated (to be entrusted to the\nGovernment Agencies or to be sold to private parties) and at the end of this project, only its\nadministrative functions (namely the University fund of human resource developments) will\nbe expected to be left. The exit policy should be determined based on the market-oriented\nconsiderations.\nVJU Fund will be responsible not only for the expansion of human resource training, but it\nwill also promote activities aiming at enhancing the University’s dynamism and\nattractiveness. For example, we can suggest the planning and holding of the sports\ncompetitions such as soccer-tournaments as well as the planning and management of the\nYouth Science-and-Technology events.\n6.3 Financial Plan and Prospects of Income and Expenditure\nWith regard to the University’s financial plan, the financial plan and budget outlook for the\nnext 10 years should be formulated and should be subject to yearly revisions according to\nthe actual result (so called, a rolling-plan). The University should consider its constructions\nand managements in 3 to 4 years later than the establishment-and-starting, principally\nbased on that “the sustainable profit of a single year” can be secured in near future. The\nfiscal balance of the University will be affected by several factors such as (1) the scale of\nfacilities and equipment, (2) the scale and contents of curriculum, and various services of\nthe University, (3) the securing of lands, (4) the supports and investments of private\ncompanies, (5) the setting of tuitions and (6) the Governments’ supports.\n25The cost of constructions and maintenance of the buildings and facilities will be covered\ninitially with ODA and the preparation of land, following with financing, investments,\nfinancial supports and donations of the Governments, private companies and other\norganizations. In the medium and long term, the cost should be covered by the\nGovernments’ supports, revenue from related services, asset-income from the buildings\nand facilities, sponsorships and investments of private companies and so on.\nThe operating cost of the University (costs of employment, education and research, etc.)\nwill be covered initially by the Governments’ subsidies, ODA, supports and cooperation of\nprivate companies, and in the long-term, the cost should be covered by the supports and\ncooperation of the Governments, charges for use of the facilities and others, revenue from\nrelated services and supports of VJU Fund and companies as well as the tuition fees.\nTaking into consideration of the tuition levels of universities in Vietnam, tuition fees of VJU\nshould be kept as low as possible according to the concept of the University. However,\nwhen offering high-level advanced services, the prices (tuition fees, user fees, etc.) should\nbe set to meet the quality of services, and it would be so rational to provide some reductions\nand financial supports under certain conditions such as “income level” and “personal\ndifficulties”. The issue will be considered continuously.\n(Reference) Current Income and Expenditure Structure of VJU\nCurrent Income (100 million yen)\nTuitions Fee\nCharge for Use of Facilities\nRevenue from Related\nServices\nRevenue from Private\nResearches and others\n3 years later, 6-7 years later, 10 years later, ODA and Government\nStarting of VJU Reconsideration Accomplishment of Supports and others\nof VJU project the VJU project\n26Current Expenditure (100 million yen)\n100\n90\n80\n70 Administrative and\n管M理a費na等gement Cost\n60\nCost of Education\n教育研究費\n50 and Research\n40 人P件er費sonnel Cost\n30\n20\n10\n0\n3 ye3a年rs後 la(t発er,足 ） 6-76 ～y7e年ars後 later, 101年0程 ye度ar後s later,\nStarting of VJU Reconsideration Accomplishment of\nof VJU project the VJU project\n6.4 Stabilization of the Income-and-Expenditure Balance\nVarious means should be considered to maintain sufficient revenue enough to keep\nfinancial stability. In addition to the land, ODA funds, acquisitions of equity investments and\ndonations, there might be several projects to be proposed for the sustainable developments\nof VJU as in the followings.\n(1) Education and Research of the University: Holding of Titled Courses of companies,\nSponsorship of Companies for establishments of the specific graduate courses and\nfor hosting symposiums, etc., and Scholarships of the Governments, private\ncompanies and relevant organizations,\n(2) Invite of Private Investments by offering advanced excellent environments of living\nand education-and-research: Establishments of the Specific Graduate Courses,\nEstablishments of the Organizations of Human Resource Training and Recruiting and\nSupports for the Developments in HHTP,\n(3) Offer of Human Resource Training services: Japanese Language Courses, various\nPractical Trainings and Internships,\n(4) Related Business Activities: long-term and short-term Accommodation Facilities,\nDormitories for trainees and students, related Sports Facilities, Implementation of\nvarious Events,\n(5) Use of Properties: Sale of Name Rights of Facilities and others mainly for Japanese\ncompanies,\n(6) Academic and Policy Programs of the Japanese and Vietnamese Governments.\n27VJU projects should be reconsidered in 3 to 4 years later than its starting, and then\nshould totally check the management, the income-and-expenditure prospect, and the\nsurrounding environments of the University in order to reconstruct its construction plan\nthen.\n7. Opening of Vietnam-Japan University\n7.1 Establishment of Vietnam-Japan Graduate School of Sustainability (a tentative name)\nFor the opening of Vietnam-Japan University in 2016, “Vietnam-Japan Graduate School\nof Sustainability (a tentative name)” would be established under VNU-Hanoi. The\nsignificance of “Sustainability” has been fully recognized in the Vietnam’s Socio-Economic\nDevelopment Strategy, so the graduate school would be established to educate/research\nthe issues such as Global Environments, Climate Change, Disaster Control, Sustainable\nDevelopments of Regions and International Public Policies comprehensively.\nAt the beginning, the school would start as the graduate school with the master’s course\nof 2 years (the first term of the doctoral course) and the doctoral degrees (the latter term of\nthe doctoral course) would be prepared with the measures such as studying at the graduate\nschools in Japan and the establishment of the joint degree programs. In addition to studying\nat the doctoral course, the target of the graduate school will be comprehensively to grow up\nthe students to leading politicians, government’s officials, leading executives/specialists of\ncompanies including Japanese companies, excellent experts and entrepreneurs.\n7.2 Curriculum of the Graduate School\nThe graduate school will offer the 2-year master’s courses and all students will be\nrequested to take the ‘International Liberal Arts’ course to learn the general basic\nknowledge which will support to develop their special researches in the future. The\n‘International Liberal Arts’ course will focus on the broad liberal arts education expanding\nstudent’s perspectives, the special basic educations connecting Vietnamese undergraduate\neducation with Japanese master’s course, and the active learning inspiring active attitudes\nfor learnings.\nThe students will learn the languages of Japanese and Vietnamese (if needed, including\nEnglish) in the course. This “International Liberal Arts” course would provide a foothold for\nthe future extending of the liberal arts education to the undergraduate level (see\nReference).\n28（Reference）Subjects (examples) of the “International Liberal Arts” course：\nSubjects of History and Japanology would be required to learn obligatorily.\nSubjects of History：Vietnamese History, Oriental History\nSubjects of Japanology：Affairs of Modern Economies、Affairs of Modern Business\nManagements\nSubjects of Economic theories：Macro Economics、Micro Economics\nSubjects of Managements：Management, Marketing\nSubjects of Laws：International Private Laws, Intellectual Properties\nThe following 4 special courses composed of 2 courses of “Humanities & Social Science”\nand 2 courses of “Natural Science”, would be established in the graduate school. In the\nmiddle of the 2020s, 4 Schools/Faculties, “Engineering and Technology” and “Medical-care,\nNursing-care, Medicine and Life-Sciences” for “Natural Science” and “Humanities, Area\nStudies, Regional Societies and Policy Sciences” and “Economics, Management, Laws &\nPublic Policies” for “Humanities & Social Science”, would be established.\nHumanities & Social Science:\n・Regional Research course :Vietnamese Affairs, Japanology (Japanese Language,\nJapanese Culture, etc.) , Regional Affairs including Japan and Vietnam in East Asia,\nContents & Design, Regional Industries (Agriculture/Forestry/Fishery, Food,\nFood-Sanitation, Distribution System, Marine Development, Tourism, Venture\nCompanies including University-Ventures, Services),\n・International Public Policies course : Development Economics, Economics (Macro\nEconomics, Micro Economics, etc.), Public Economics, Business Managements\n(Management, Marketing, Company Establishments, etc.), Finance, M&A, Laws\n(International Private Laws, Intellectual Properties and other laws), City Planning,\nPublic Policies,\nNatural Science:\n・Environment and Disaster Control Studies course : Environments, Disaster\nControl, Urban Engineering, Construction, Civil Engineering, Energy (Atomic Energy,\netc.), Housing, Landscaping, etc.\n・Environment and Life Sciences course : Life Science, Biotechnology, Genome,\nNano-Science, Health & Physical Training, etc.+(Medical Care, Nursing-Care,\nMedicine, etc.)\nThe following subjects will be considered also.\n・Advanced Mechanical Engineering : Automobile, Electronic Machineries, Robots,\nRailway, Shipbuilding, etc.\n・New Material : Irons, Chemistries, New Materials, etc.\n29Reference\n7.3 Students and University Staff of the Graduate School\nIn the starting of VJU, each of the 4 courses will admit 20 applicants every year, and then\nthe students of the graduate school will be about 80 persons in total for each grade.\nAs for the University staff, The Japanese universities will dispatch 10 professors/ lecturers\nfor the International Liberal Arts course and 5-10 people for each special course（about 40\npeople in total (see a note)).\nVJU will have the schedule to increase special courses and subjects of lectures\nsuccessively, and in 6 to 7 years later, the University will have a total enrollment of more\nthan 1000 students mainly composed of the graduate students, especially 300 students\nyearly for the master’s course.\nOn dispatching Japanese staff to VJU, it might be better to apply the long-term expert\ndispatch system of JICA or the like for the time being until the system receiving them will be\nestablished. In addition, it would be able to increase the staff in association with private\ncompanies and in accordance with the investments increased step-by-step.\n(Note) The Japanese staff of VJU at its starting (Image)\n・5 persons for each special course excluding the “Life and Environmental Science”\ncourse (about 15 persons in total for 3 special courses)\n5 persons: a professor, an associate professor, an assistant professor and 2\nresearch associates\n30・About 10 persons for the “Life and Environmental Science” course\n10 persons: 2 professors, 2 associate professors, 2 assistant professors and 4\nresearch associates\n・About 10 persons for the “International Liberal Arts”\nProfessors: 1 for History, 1 for Economy, 1 for Management, 1 for Laws and 1 for\nPublic Policy\nAssistant professors: 1 for History, 1 for Economy, 1 for Management, 1 for Laws\nand 1 for Public Policy\n7.4 Establishment of the Japanese Language Educational Institute\nVJU will establish the Japanese language educational institute. The institute will have the\nnight classes of Japanese Language for the students of the school before and after their\nenrollment to the school, and will intensively strengthen their abilities of Japanese\nLanguage.\nThe educational staff of the school will be tentatively 5 persons for the admittances of 80\npersons. However, under the strong demand for Japanese language education of the\nhuman resource development of Vietnam-Japan University, and of Japanese companies,\nthe staff would be increased probably.\n7.5 Training of the University Staff\nVJU should be on the administration and management of Vietnamese staff in the\ncooperation with the Japanese universities and Japanese companies as early as possible.\nTherefore, it will be necessary to promote several activities such as the studying-in-Japan\nprogram of the University staff engaging in education, research and managements, the\nmiddle/long-term trainings and the improvements of training circumstances including ICT\nRemote Lectures/Seminars, an E-Library construction and industry-academia\ncollaborations.\nAs to the “Promotion of industry-academia collaboration” especially, there would be a lot\nof research themes such as the developments of supporting industries, the promotion of\nsight-seeing industries and the establishment of distribution systems.\n7.6 Training of Highly Qualified Specialists and Technical Experts and Supports for their\nEmployments\nVJU will undertake the training of highly qualified specialists and technical experts, and\nthe supports for their employments, based on the needs of Japanese companies and on the\nVietnamese needs of the society and students in cooperation with the current training\nprograms and personnel training organizations. The specific details would be clarified in the\ncoming study and in the next feasibility study.\n318. Construction Plan of Vietnam-Japan University\n8.1 Outline\nVJU will be established as the University with the graduate school. The construction of\nthe University will be scheduled by dividing the target period of about 10 years into three\nstages.\nIn the first stage, the feasibility study will be immediately carried out in details and the\nmaster’s course (the first period of the doctoral course) of the graduate school named\nVietnam-Japan Graduate School of Sustainability (a tentative name), will be established in\nthree years as the core of VJU. In association with VNU-Hanoi, VJU will begin its activities\nas in the followings.\n(1) Preparations for the coming units and graduate-courses by each research-group, or\nby professor, or by course,\n(2) Establishment of the systems and circumstances for education and research allowing\neffective works of professors, lecturers and other staff of the University,\n(3) Recruiting and fostering of eligible professors and lecturers of Japan and Vietnam,\n(4) Training of highly qualified specialists and technical experts,\n(5) Promotion of the supports and relevant investments of companies and organizations.\nUtilizing the Japanese education programs such as “Twinning System”, “Double Degree”\nand “advancement to the doctoral courses”, the small graduate school will be establish at\nthe early stage, then later the school will be soon expanded to the University with\nundergraduate courses.\nIn the next 3 to 4 years (the second stage), VJU will establish the latter term of the\ndoctoral courses and some undergraduate courses to be the full university with the\ngraduate school. In this stage, the requirements for sustainable developments of VJU, such\nas the income-and-expenditure prospects, the situation of Land prepared, the supports and\ninvestments of the Governments and private companies, and the specific needs of students\nand companies, will be clarified, so the construction plan of the University should be\nseriously examined from a viewpoint of its sustainable development in the market. In this\nperiod, the University staff will be supposed to be replaced with Vietnamese as many as\npossible.\nConcerning the further development of VJU, VJU would be necessary to decide in this\noccasion (1) if it would maintain/develop the original plan and would continue further\ninvestments, or (2) if it would maintain the current situation and would watch for the\nopportunity of further developments, or (3) if would be set back to merge with VNU or to\ntake the students to the Japanese Universities. There would be almost no possibility to get\n32the last situation, but might be left some possibility in the cases of the emergence of other\nuniversities with better managements, or in the case of the bad managements of VJU.\nAccording to the plan, at latest in the last three years (in the third stage) some Japanese\nUniversities would collaborate to establish four schools/faculties based on their own\nadministrations and managements in fields of Natural Sciences and Humanities & Social\nSciences.\n8.2 Construction Plan\n(1) The first stage: Opening VJ Graduate School of Sustainability (the master’s courses or\nthe first term of the doctoral courses)\nIt will be immediately necessary to carry out a feasibility study for the establishment of VJ\nGraduate School of Sustainability in three years.\nFor the purpose of the establishment of the doctoral courses and the faculties, related\nlectures and seminars will be started and practical human resource trainings will also be\nheld for high-level specialists and technical experts.\nThe school will be started in the rented flat of the building in Hanoi central. At the same\ntime the constructions of the satellite campus in Hanoi central and of the campus in\nHoa-Lac Hi-Tech Park (HHTP), and possibly in the relocation site of VNU-Hanoi also, will be\nstarted.\nThe graduate school will start with 160 students (the quota) of the master’s courses and\nwith around 40 persons of professors and lecturers.\n(2) The second stage: Establishment of the full doctoral courses and of small\nundergraduate schools\nThe full courses of doctoral program and small undergraduate schools will be established\ndepending on the needs of students and Japanese companies and on the line-up of the\nUniversity staff until 6 or 7 years later.\nUpgrading a variety of high-level human resource development programs, expanding the\ntraining courses, opening industry-academia collaboration facilities including companies’\nresearch institutions, and financial supports and investments of Japanese companies will\nbe promoted.\nIn this period, the satellite campus in Hanoi central and the campus in HHTP will be\nprogressively constructed and will be put into use, and the shuttle bus service will be started.\nWhile in the beginning stage of the graduate school, the school will be located at the\nsatellite campus and HHTP campus, its functions of education and research will be moved\nto the VNU campus upon the completion of preparing the campus in Hoa Lac, and the\n33HHTP campus will be assigned to the functions such as industry-academia collaborations,\nresearch institutions, human resource developments and companies’ R&D investments.\nThe number of students will amount to 1000~2000 including more than 700\npost-graduates, and then the Graduate Schools of Natural Science and of Humanities &\nSocial Sciences will have been fully established.\nThe requirements for the sustainable development of VJU such as the\nincome-and-expenditure prospects, the situation of the land, the supports and investments\nof the Governments and private companies and the needs of students and companies, will\nbe clarified, so the construction plan of the University should be reviewed from a viewpoint\nof the sustainable developments.\n(3) The third stage: Achieving the original goal\nAssuming the progress of construction of VJU as scheduled, a total of 4 schools/faculties\n(2 for humanities & social sciences, and 2 for natural sciences) would be established. The\nrelevant facilities such as industry-academia cooperation facilities and research institutions\nwould be also constructed and a variety of high-level human resource development\nprograms and training courses would have been developed to mid-2020.\nIn this time, the visits of Japanese students and experts of various fields would be\nincreased and various symposiums and lectures will be held frequently. The satellite\ncampus in Hanoi central should be developed to the center of those activities and events.\nAs for the facilities of VJU, all of the VNU/HHTP campus in Hoa-Lac and the satellite\ncampus in the Hanoi central would be in operation. Then the number of students will\namount to about 6,000 persons including 2,400 persons of postgraduates and to about 300\npersons of professors and lecturers and about 200 persons of the University staff.\n(Reference) The Construction Plan\nof Japan-Vietnam University\n349. Expected Outcome of Vietnam-Japan University\nThe Vietnam-Japan University project is the grand vision, which will contribute in the\ncooperation of Politicians, the Governments, Universities and Companies to (1) the\nEstablishment of the World-class Leading University with the graduate school and its\nleading human resource developments, (2) the Practical Trainings of highly qualified\nSpecialists, Technical Experts and companies’ executives, (3) the Promotion of Private\nInvestments mainly of Japanese companies, (4) the Establishment of Advanced Living\nEnvironments and (5) the Developments of VNU, Hanoi and Hoa-Lac Hi-Tech Park, and\nwhich will be along the Vietnamese “Socio-Economic Development Strategy for\n2011-2020”.\nAt first, VJU will develop creative human resources who will have the equivalent level of\nbroad knowledge to the students of Japanese leading universities in various fields. This will\nlead to develop the leaders who will have cross-sectional networks of various societies\nincluding between Japan and Vietnam.\nSecondly, VJU will broadly develop highly qualified practical human resources of\nspecialists, technical-experts and corporate executives based on the needs of Vietnamese\nstudents and the companies mainly of Japanese ones. Those will be such as (1) the\nparticipations of companies, industrial executives and engineers into academic activities of\nthe University, (2) the research and business activities on Industry-academia collaboration,\nand (3) supports for recruitment of companies.\nThirdly, concerning the promotion of private investments mainly of Japanese companies,\nVJU may appeal the features in the specific fields such as “the treatment for the demand of\nhigh-level human resources”, “the providing of comfortable safe advanced living\nenvironments to business executives and technical experts” and “the most favorable place\nto facilitate the joint R&D/ business-development projects between Japan and Vietnam.”\nFourthly, providing advanced living environments would be just the purpose which the\nUniversity should seek for. The people living there will form the global leading community\nnot only in the academic societies but also in the practical societies.\nFifthly, needless to say, VJU will surely contribute to the developments of VNU, Hanoi\nand Hoa-Lac Hi-Tech Park and of Vietnam.\n35It is also essentially important for Japan and Japanese companies to share thoughts\nglobally and to develop our societies together with Vietnam and Vietnamese when we have\nbeen facing the tidal waves of the globalization and various drastic changes in the\ninternational environments. In this meaning, Vietnam-Japan University should be developed\nsoon into the University where many Japanese students can also learn in near future.\nWe’ve convinced the huge contribution of the VJU project not only for Vietnamese\nsocio-economic developments but also for the reinforcement and developments of the\nrelationships between Japan and Vietnam.\n36"
