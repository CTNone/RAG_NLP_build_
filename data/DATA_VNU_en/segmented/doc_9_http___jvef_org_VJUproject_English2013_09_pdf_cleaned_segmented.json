    "Vietnam-Japan University project In 2006, the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians Friendship League (then President Tsutomu Takebe) was inquired about human resource developments of Vietnam by H.E. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, and the League was also requested to support the establishment of a place of human resource training in participation of Japanese companies by H.E. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Thien Nhan (then Minister of Education and Training). Then the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians Friendship League held a study under the leadership of then Chairman Toshihiro Nikai (President of Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians Friendship League), and the League proposed the establishment of a university and a human resource training center for the purpose of advancing training and technical skill, and of popularizing Japanese language education. In October 2006, Prime Minister Shinzou Abe and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung signed the Japan-Vietnam Joint Statement, in which the Construction of Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park was included as one of the three main cooperation projects of Japanese Government. Based on a series of the above proceedings, the Vietnam-Japan University project (the VJU project) has been deliberated by Japan Vietnam Economic Forum (JVEF) based on The Project to establish a university graduate-school with global standards for aiming at its autonomously sustainable developments on the private market, which will be principally considered to locate the University at Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park (HHTP) or at the scheduled relocation site of Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-Hanoi) in Hoa-Lac.",
    "The Project has been promoted under the support of the Leaders of Vietnamese Government and Japanese Government, and in association with VNU-Hanoi. Currently, the VJU project has been promoted on the political leadership, gaining strong supports and assistances from the Parliamentarians Friendship Leagues of both countries including H.E. President Toshihiro Nikai and H.E. President To Hyu Rua. At JVEF, the Meeting of Japanese Universities was organized to deliberate the establishment project of the University last year, getting participation of the prominent professors of leading Japanese Universities such as the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Osaka University, University of Tsukuba, Nagoya University, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Waseda University, Ritsumeikan University, Kinki University Takushoku University and so on (not-in-order). The meeting, which is co-chaired by Dr. Motoh Furuta, a professor of Tokyo University, and Dr. Michiaki Mishima, Vice-President of Kyoto University, has been deliberating the organization, curriculums and 4other detailed matters of VJU, on holding a series of discussions with VNU-Hanoi in VJU Project Taskforce. In the beginning of 2013, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has started Vietnam-Japan University Project Information Collection and Confirmation Survey in order to analyze the accumulated basic information relating to the VJU project and to clarify problems.",
    "JVEF has formed a consortium with related organizations to accept the survey. Currently, the VJU project has been promoted well based on the inquiries of this survey. In March of this year, JVEF established VJU Project Taskforce jointly with Vietnam National University, Hanoi. The Taskforce is mainly composed of the eminent professors and experts of related Japanese universities and VNU-Hanoi. The Chairman of the Japanese side is Mr. Tsutomu Takebe, Honorary President of JVEF (current Special Advisor of the Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians Friendship League) and the Chairman of the Vietnamese side is Prof. Dr. Mai Trong Nhuan, former President of VNU-Hanoi. The Taskforce has been executing the JICA survey smoothly and has been also coordinating various issues with the Governments and the universities both of Japan and Vietnam, and Japanese companies, taking into consideration of the surrounding situations such as the construction of Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park and the VNU relocation project. Since last March, Mr. Tsutomu Takebe, Special Advisor of Japan-Vietnam Parliamentarians Friendship League, has hold serious discussions with the Leaders of Vietnamese Government such as H.E. President Truong Tan San, H.E.",
    "Mr. To Hyu Rua (President of Vietnam-Japan Parliamentarians Friendship League), H.E. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, H.E. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Thien Nhan, and other eminent Leaders. Their prominent Leaders have unanimously agreed quickly to establish Vietnam-Japan University under the umbrella of VNU-Hanoi, and to build it as promised before at Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park. In addition, they have also promised to secure enough land to construct VJU. This project draft has been summed up based on the proposals and considerations of the above eminent people supporting the project. 5(Reference) Vietnam-Japan University Project Taskforce (Established March 11, 2013) VJU Taskforce, Japan VJU Taskforce, Vietnam VJU Meeting of Japanese Universities 62. Outline of Vietnam-Japan University 2. 1 Basic Principles Vietnam-Japan University including the Graduate School has the basic principles to develop the people which will contribute to strengthen the relationship between Japan and Vietnam as the base for Vietnamese developments and the mutual understanding of both countries and it aims to be a leading university in Asia. The basic principles of its establishment are in the followings.",
    "(1) To provide high-quality education capable to study in leading Japanese universities (2) To provide practical education based on Japanese technologies and experiences (3) To establish the university in accordance with the current cooperation of universities of both countries (4) To respect for the initiatives of each university (5) To implement lectures and human resource trainings in Japanese Language principally as well as in English VJU will be established in the next ten years as the University with preparing both fields of natural sciences and humanities such as (1) Science and Technology, (2) Medical Care, Nursing Care and Medicine, (3) Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, (4) Japanology, (5) Law and (6) Economics and Management. VJU will be established as the University with 4 kinds of schools faculties with graduate schools, which will be broadly grouped in order to be able to keep cross-sectional connections between advanced specializations. A lot of new cross-sectional research activities and the establishments of experimental and or Industry-academia collaboration institutions should be promoted in cooperation with various special courses of the University, 72.2 Characteristics The characteristics of VJU, in addition to the international level of education and research, will be as in the followings.",
    "(1) To use Japanese Language principally as well as English in order to promote the invitation of prominent Japanese professors and researchers in various special fields, and to make it possible for Vietnamese students to obtain their jobs smoothly in Japanese companies, (2) To integrate education and research and to emphasize collaborations and cooperation with companies in various fields such as industry-academia collaborations, research activities, lectures by companies and special human resource trainings, (3) To support students and researchers in their studying-abroad and in obtaining jobs from Japanese companies, (4) To employ support Vietnamese students studied in Japan progressively, (5) To establish Liberal Arts (general basic education) and community education in order to develop advanced special fields creatively, (6) To implement advanced ICT educations such as interactive remote lectures seminars. 8These above characteristics will be consistent with the goals of the Vietnamese Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2011-2020 which states Education shall be a leading national policy, for the purpose of upgrading the quality of human resources, the comprehensive improvement of education and training, and the swift development of the country.",
    "Especially, training of management executives, skilled specialists, business executives, scientists and skilled experts will be important. In addition, the University will be consistent with human resource needs of the Vietnamese developing society and of Japanese companies. Above all, the University will be indispensable to construct the bridgehead of Japan-Vietnam cooperation for the future in the globalizing world. 2.3 Scope and Location VJU will have about 6,000 students including about 2,400 graduate students in the first ten years, in which about 2,200 students will be in Natural Sciences and about 3,800 students will be in Humanities and Social Sciences. Almost all students especially will take the master s courses of the graduate school. Following the Vietnamese state of the economy, industries and the society, and the needs for those developments, the University will train specialists and technical experts with highly qualified skills in a variety of fields, but those details will be clarified in the coming research and in the future feasibility study. At first, the University will hasten to construct the campus in Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park (HHTP). In the medium term, the campus in HHTP will be used for research laboratories, Industry-academia collaborations and human resource trainings for specialists and the campus in VNU will be used for education and basic researches.",
    "The campus of VJU will be about 100 ha wide, and the site for the related activities such as research in laboratories, Industry-academia collaboration and practical training of human resource will be about 100 ha wide. The satellite campus of VJU should be established in the Hanoi central. It would be indispensable to manage the satellite and the main campus in Hoa-Lac totally. The reason why the number of students will be relatively small compared with the big campus is at first that the University should keep wide open environments enough to be developed to the University like so-called Stanford Univ. or Harvard Univ. of Asia in the future. In addition, there will be a lot of plans to expand related activities including those of private companies such as establishing research laboratories, Industry-academia collaborations and constructions of experimental facilities, and the additional space of the training programs of high qualified specialists and technical experts should be considered from now on. 9Executives and specialists of private companies including Japanese companies mainly will be invited to take roles of lecturers and specialists in the University. 2.4 Facilities and Equipment Regarding facilities and equipment of the University, it will be necessary to prepare the excellent environments, where prominent professors, business executives and leading specialists around the world including Japan mainly, should be invited as lecturers researchers heads-of-laboratories smoothly, and they should be able to hold various meetings and seminars flexibly.",
    "As a leading university, VJU should indispensably have an advanced e-library (24hours open), a communication center for researchers and students, an international conference hall, Industry-academia collaboration centers, all-weather athletic facilities (night open), excellent accommodations and hotels for the needs and purposes of visitors and students under the environments of an advanced ICT, energy saving and affluent nature. It will be also so important to supply high quality services in Japanese style and to keep the excellent administration and the efficient management. It means to prepare the advanced services and facilities which executives and specialists of private companies in around VJU could enjoy. Preparing the above facilities, equipment and related excellent services, VJU should surely prepare good conditions for private companies including Japanese companies to promote their investments and locations in Hoa-Lac. 102.5 Organization and Fund VJU will be scheduled to be established as a university under the umbrella of Vietnam National University, Hanoi. The VJU secretariat s function will be organized by a consortium of VNU-Hanoi, the participating Japanese Universities, JVEF and other related organizations. VJU will be financially expected to be self-supportive and the maximum level of autonomy should be provided for the administration and managements including curriculum formations and personnel managements.",
    "Under the above conditions, a powerful secretariat should be set up for the efficient constructions and management. Basic capital assets for the construction and management of VJU will be composed of the ODA fund prepared by Japanese Government and the land prepared by Vietnamese Government, and it should be additionally considered to seek for various financial sources such as financing of banks, donations and investments from companies and so on. For the purpose of the prompt constructions and the efficient management of the University, Vietnam-Japan University Fund (VJU Fund, a tentative name) should be established, and VJU Fund would execute various supporting activities such as assignments of professors and lecturers to the University, planning and management of seminars and symposiums, job-searching for VJU students including students studying in Japan, promotion of industry-academia collaboration, and efficient managements and constructions of the related services and facilities which should be totally designed. 2.6 Construction Plan VJU would be scheduled to be established 3 years later as Vietnam-Japan Sustainability Graduate School (VJSS, tentative) at a temporary campus in the Hanoi central. Then the constructions of facilities in the HHTP campus and the satellite campus should be also started and related activities such as the recruitment of professors and the trial courses of lectures will be also started.",
    "In 6 to 7 years, VJU will hold lectures and research activities in the new campus buildings and the constructions of facilities and its activities will have been expanded continuously. The University will promote various activities such as trainings of high qualified specialist and technical experts for the needs of Japanese companies, establishments of the faculties of VJU and industry-academia collaborations. Checking the constructions and the income-expenditure balance of VJU, VJU will strengthen its constructions and related activities for aiming at establishment of the University with 6000 students about 10 years later It will be necessary to keep 3 Es factors as in the followings in order to realize the VJU project. 11(1) Excellent education and research of VJU, eminent professors and related researchers specialists supporting high quality, and good students, (2) Enough funds and assets such as ODA, land for the campus, financing of banks, various governments supports, private donations, corporate investments and other assets for excellent facilities equipment and related good services, as well as support of VNU-Hanoi, (3) Effective market-based managements of VJU to maintain its sustainable development.",
    "3. Organization and Administration Management of Vietnam-Japan University 3.1 Organization VJU under the umbrella of VNU, will be scheduled to be developed to the University which will provide various courses of natural-science humanities courses such as (1) Science and Technology, (2) Medical care, Nursing care, Medicine, (3) Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery, (4) Economics and Management, (5) Laws and (6) Japanology and Japanese language in around 10 years. VJU will be also broadly grouped to about 4 schools or faculties including the graduate schools. These schools faculties will have the features such as the fostering of creative leading specialists mastered the general basic education course (the liberal arts) and the community-based educations accompanied with various club circle activities emphasizing human-growth and human-relations in the societies. The University will be scheduled to be established in 3 years as Vietnam-Japan Sustainability Graduate School (a tentative name), and it will be developed step by step after its starting. VJU will mainly provide high-level education and research with the united programs for under-graduates and post-graduates and will also have the training program of high-qualified specialists and technical experts.",
    "The organization and management of VJU will be considered flexibly in accordance with various conditions such as various matters of Vietnamese side, its budget and the placements of professors and lecturers. The number of VJU students will be a total of approximately 6,000 students including 2,400 post-graduates in about 10 years. VJU will have about 900 under-graduate students per school year, about 900 students per school year (2 years) for the master s program (the first term of the doctoral course) and 200 students per school year for the doctoral program (the latter term of the doctoral course). There will be totally about 2,200 students in Natural Sciences and about 3,800 students in Humanities and Social Sciences and almost all students will be scheduled to enter the master s course of the graduate school. The training of highly qualified specialists and technical experts will be also considered specifically 12according to the needs of the Vietnamese society and companies including Japanese companies in Vietnam. The number of education research staff for the above students, would be estimated to be about 300 persons, 180 of whom in Natural Science, and 120 in Humanities and Social Science.",
    "Considering the staff for various research institutions and the diversification of the fields of education and research, the scale of staff would be probably expanded. Details of University staff and students will be clarified in the coming survey and in the Feasibility Study (FS). Their details should be also revised every year.

The administration and management of VJU should be established on the strong authority with the adequate autonomy (independence) of the University.",
    "Concerning common matters of all VJU or of several universities, it would be necessary for the VJU secretariat to take part in coordination of those matters. The secretariat of VJU should have the responsibilities for the total process of construction of VJU and should be in charge of the matters such as the formation of university courses for under-graduates and for post-graduates, the fiscal plan, the formation and execution of the budget and coordination with VJU Fund. As for the curriculum formations and the recruitment of professors and staff of the University, those will be mostly treated by the Japanese universities in charge of the administration and management or by VJU secretariat. In the cooperation and integrated developments with VNU-Hanoi, VJU will promote the recruitment of Vietnamese staff including lecturers and management staff, and will train them for the purpose of shifting most jobs of the University to Vietnamese as soon as possible. VJU will invite more 13Japanese universities in Vietnam and other countries for participations and cooperation to the project. The fields established in VJU and the Japanese universities in charge of them will be tentatively assumed as in the followings.",
    "Science and Technology The University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Osaka University, The University of Tsukuba, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Ritsumeikan University, Kinki University Medical Science Care, Nursing care, Medicine, Life Science Osaka University, The University of Tsukuba, Nagoya University, Kinki University, Ritsumeikan University, (Kyoto University) Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery Kinki University, Economics, Business and Management (including Policy Science and Public Policy) Osaka University, Kinki University, Ritsumeikan University, Kaetsu University Law Nagoya University Japanology and Japanese Language The University of Tokyo, The University of Tsukuba, Waseda University, Takushoku University 3.3 Training of Highly Qualified Specialists and Technical Experts Vietnam-Japan University will train highly qualified specialists and technical experts especially for the needs of Vietnamese students societies and Japanese companies.

Besides providing practical education and training, VJU will train a lot of Vietnamese business people such as entrepreneurs of small medium sized companies, highly qualified technical experts in the fields of infrastructure constructions and managing executives of Japanese companies in association with the existing human resource training programs.",
    "It will be also taken into consideration to establish The College of Technology with the existing similar activities. VJU will also develop human resources for new businesses such as M A support services for fostering entrepreneurs and specialists. 3.4 Promotion of Industry-academia collaboration and Encouragement of Private Investments In addition to widely-ranged practical education-and-research activities, VJU will be actively promote Industry-academia collaboration and will surely welcome various investments of private companies including Japanese companies for the purpose of (1) securing good employments for students and researchers, (2) Enhancement of the 14qualities of university s research activities through promoting joint researches with private companies, (3) Strengthening practical education through receiving executives of companies and qualified specialists as lecturers, and (4) Keeping important sources of income such as direct supports of companies and their investments. Therefore VJU will actively provide related services in the occasions of acceptances of the investments and relevant human resources of companies. The advantages for Japanese companies in the cases such as the locations of research facilities, will be of (1) High living environments and excellent locations, (2) Comfortable living education business environments of using Japanese language, (3) Advantages taking the relevant services of human resource trainings of Japanese language, Japanese culture and other practical specific sectors, (4) Trainings of highly qualified specialists and technical experts, (5) Favorable image for the companies cooperating in human resource trainings in Vietnam, (6) Reduction of investment risks (in the cases of those starting and retreatment, gathering of information and various managements), (7) Acquisition of information concerning various researches and developments in Vietnam, (8) Contribution to the VJU VNU activities such as the lecture-hosting, the acceptance of interns, and joint researches.",
    "4. Characteristics of the Education and Research of Vietnam-Japan University 4.1 Basic Principles of the Education and Research VJU should develop creative human resource leading our society as an advanced university with international standards, and for the purpose of further developments of cooperation of Japan and Vietnam, each field of VJU should also have various practical roles such as (1) The role of Science Technology and Engineering and Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery will be to foster students for highly qualified specialists and technical experts and business executives and managers of companies and organizations, (2) The role of Medical Science Care, Nursing Care, Medicine, Life Science will provide integrated training including practical trainings for highly qualified specialists, (3) The role of Economics, Business and Management will be to foster students for qualified specialists concerning economics and public policies, and for leading business persons such as entrepreneurs, senior executives of companies, financial experts and so on, and (4) The role of Japanology and Japanese language will be to train students for leading specialists to promote cultural exchange developments of both countries as well as the education of Japanese language.",
    "The education and research of VJU should be integrated to ensure a high level of 15education with international standards. The University will have the curriculums founded on the practical education and research keeping strong ties with our societies. The characteristics of the curriculum will be as in the followings (1) Highly creative human resource developments founded on liberal arts (general basic education) required in special studies, (2) Hosting practical and attractive lectures and seminars of prominent professors and business executives, (3) Community-forming education and research based on human relations, (4) Service offering to meet various needs through the functional human network between the relevant Universities, (5) Japanese-style human resource trainings such as social basic training, human-relations and communication, and supports for job-placements, (6) Development of educational environments of Japanese language, (7) Promotion of the education-in-English and the global education, (8) Establishment of the leading environment of education and research with advanced ICT (Information Communication Technology). For the purpose of ensuring the creative environments responding flexibly to various issues in the changing society economy, it would be so important for the development of the University whether its schools faculties could create cross-sectional cooperation such as establishments of joint laboratories and institutions, evading sectionalism and isolationism, and whether the The Common Identity of the University including various factors could be established.",
    "4.2 Characteristics of the Education and Research (1) Importance of the Liberal Arts (General Basic Education) In order to realize the broad high-level liberal arts (general basic education) supporting developments of advanced education in special fields, and to train human resource to respond creatively and flexibly to various issues of our society and economy, the liberal arts courses (general basic education such as history, society culture legal systems, information processing statistics, management, policy science) are very important in the University. (2) Holding of Practical and Attractive Seminars and Courses by Prominent Professors and Business Executives VJU will promote to accept the research-and-development investments and the prior investments of companies as well as the establishments of the research institutions and the laboratories in association with companies. For this purpose, relay lectures and seminars of prominent professors and senior executives of leading companies visiting Vietnam will be held frequently. VJU will hold the titled-courses donated-courses of companies and students in Vietnam will be able to take remote-lectures held in Japan with advanced ICT. In addition, for the lectures which would not be able to hold in Hanoi due to scheduling of 16lecturers and to some difficulties of equipment installments, the network of each Japanese Universities will be establish to meet the broad needs by preparing intensive courses as well as studying in Japan.",
    "(3) Community-forming Education and Research based on Human Relations VJU will actively provide students direct guidance by the professors or the supervisors as well as supports for job-searching or career guidance. In addition, the University will encourage extra-curricular club and circle activities of sports and cultures, and will make students create Sense-of-Responsibilities to our society and Abilities to Participation-and-Contributions to their communities. (4) Service-Offering to meet Various Needs by the Functional Human Network of the Japanese Universities VJU, accepting financial contributions and supports from Japanese companies and the assistance and participation of leading Japanese Universities, will engage in promotion of industry-academia collaboration and in training of highly qualified human resource. Taking use of the internship system and Industry-academia collaboration through the networks, VJU will offer students good career-guidance and supports for job-searching. (5) Japanese-style Human Resource Trainings such as Social Basic Training, Human-Relations and Communication, and Supports for Job-Searching VJU will develop human resource in a Japanese style, while paying attentions to global factors, and will promote for students to secure jobs at Japanese companies smoothly. Even after their graduation, the University will prepare the opportunities for development of their abilities to continue their studies and researches in the graduate school, and to provide supports for job-searching continuously.",
    "(6) Development of Educational Environments of Japanese Language VJU will fortify the educational environments of Japanese language thoroughly. When students could master Japanese language, they would be able to get qualifications to study in Japan and would be so smooth to get employments. The University will create favorable environments efficiently to learn Japanese language for Vietnamese and to learn Vietnamese language for Japanese. The University will provide opportunities for people to learn Japanese at reasonable charges, for example as the implementation of a certifying examination of Japanese Language. (7) Promotion of Education in English and the Global Education For Vietnamese needs for the Globalization, VJU will prepare a lot of English lectures and a series of global events, for example, as a key center of the Asian area. The University will provide bridges for Japanese students and companies trainees to study in Vietnam. 17English will be used in the global fields of Science and Technology, and Both of Japanese and English will be used in the fields of industry-academia collaboration with Japanese companies. Japanese should be used in the fields of Laws and other broad fields where various Japanese Specialists and Technical Experts will be considered to have main roles, and supposedly among a majority of various business specialists and technical experts for effective communications and further developments of cooperation of both countries.",
    "(8) Establishment of the Advanced Environments of Education and Research with ICT (Information Communication Technology) and relevant facilities The University area should be constructed as the advanced demonstration area of education-and-research living environments for the next generation. VJU will prepare comfortable living environments for people with plenty of green-and-water, safety-and-security, friendly-kindness for children, elder people and foreign visitors as well as the advanced Information Communication Technology. 4.3 Education and Research by Each Grade It will be basically assumed that almost all students of VJU will study up to the master s course (the first term of the doctoral course). In the first two years grades of undergraduates, the courses of the University will be mainly consisted of basic ones such as learning Japanese education thoroughly, and liberal arts including in Vietnamese. The students who will have required language skills will be permitted to take special courses. English lessons will be also implemented actively. The studies of general basic subjects will be indispensable to foster creativities in special fields, and in addition, cross-sectional human communications and various community-activities before entering special fields, will create important opportunities for developments of studies and researches in special fields.",
    "In the third-and-fourth years grades of undergraduates, students will study in Japanese and English (the language used would be decided by the course) and a part of students may go to study in Japan. As it will be necessary to keep various curriculums and to carry out lectures and seminars efficiently, we will construct an advanced ICT network strongly connected with Japanese Universities, and will create the University-Community in such ways as providing with a lot of opportunities of communication by holding remote studies lectures forums seminars in various places. As for the languages-used-in-lectures (Japanese or English), those level will depend on the courses selected by students, but it would be commonly requested to learn Japanese-used-daily at least. In any case, students would be necessary to be supported by some auxiliary means to get a certain level of language skills. For setting up Japanese language courses, the supports and cooperation 18of VNU-Hanoi including other eminent Vietnamese universities might be indispensable. VJU will be scheduled to start the graduate school with the master s course (the first term, 2 years, of the doctoral course).",
    "For the developments of advanced research in special fields and the implementations of high-level liberal arts education supporting them, the students of 1st grade of the master s course, would be asked to learn international liberal arts courses principally. For the doctoral program, which will be the 3-year-program following the master s course, VJU would consider to respond by combining study-in-Japan programs and joint-degree systems and by other ways for the time being. VJU would haste to establish a full graduate school as soon as possible anyway. 5. Location and Facilities of Vietnam-Japan University 5.1 Location VJU would be scheduled to be established at Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park (HHTP) and at the relocation site of Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU-Hanoi) in Hanoi. The University should be developed to a leading one in the world in cooperation with VNU-Hanoi. To be a leading one, VJU should be in the advanced favorable environments where a lot of surrounding organizations such as laboratories of companies, institutions of Industry-academia collaboration, and organizations of highly qualified human resource development, would be located, and where a lot of relevant investments would be realized by them.",
    "In addition, VJU should establish the attractive environments for people such as (1) the broad and open campus with a lot of green-and water, (2) the comfortable living environment for children, seniors and foreigners, (3) securing of security and safety, (4) segregation between people and cars, (5) barrier-free for handicapped people, and should be able to invite prominent professors, senior executives of companies, various leading specialists and so on, and then a lot of leading companies including Japanese companies would most probably increase related investments in Hoa lac and in the surrounding areas. The campus of VJU should be expected to be totally about 100 ha in about 10 years. Furthermore, since the University will be planning to establish research institutions and relevant facilities under industry-academia collaboration, to practice practical human resource trainings in various fields and to accept a lot of investments of private companies. Therefore it would be necessary to secure around 200 ha including the above sites. In addition, the satellite campus (of about 2 5 ha), should be constructed in the Hanoi central to complement the remoteness of Hoa-Lac campus (30 km west of the Hanoi central).",
    "Connecting between Hoa-Lac and the Hanoi central by rapid-and-reliable shuttle 19bus service, we might expect the Hoa-Lac Campus to be so near to the Hanoi central (Note). The satellite campus, which should be a Japanese cultural exchange center, would also make an important role as the gateway-to-Hoa-Lac, in which offices of the Japanese Universities, Japanese companies and relevant organizations, accommodations and hotels for long term residents would be located. (Note) The commuting time between the satellite campus and the Hoa-Lac campus should be under 30 minutes. 5.2 Buildings Facilities and Surrounding Environments Concerning VJU buildings facilities and related services, for the purpose of the construction of an advanced attractive campus, VJU, paying attentions to an advanced ICT, energy-saving and environment-protections, should construct various buildings and facilities such as a E-Library (operating for 24 hours), a Communication Center for students (a place for various social interactions Japanese Vietnamese restaurants dining-rooms, communication areas, small medium sized event halls, etc. ), a University Hall (an auditorium, big rooms for large events, etc.",
    "), a Science and Technology Museum (for the purpose of fostering the youth dream for manufacturing and of fostering youth interest in Science and Technology), a Industry-and-Manufacturing Museum (a showcase of the 20back-ground of Japanese Manufacturing Power, introduction of the roles of various Small-and-Medium-sized Companies, Industry-Academia Collaborations, etc. ), an advanced ICT, surrounding environments (Broad open spaces, Parks with plants, flowers and water (Japanese garden, etc. )), Playgrounds and a Sports-Center (open at night and in all weather), Welfare Facilities and Accommodations. Short-and-long-term accommodations hotels will also be required for the Universities staff including researchers, specialists, technical experts, students and so on. The high-quality administration such as safety-and-security, friendly area for seniors, children and travelers, an area for human-beings, and the efficient management should be provided. For establishments of companies research institutes by industry-academia collaboration, relevant investments, sponsorships and others, it would be necessary to prepare effective facilities to receive those investments. VNU-Hanoi is planning to carry out a series of infrastructure constructions at the VNU relocation site by methods such as PPP, BOT and others with the Construction Ministry, and the details of its schedule and contents should be confirmed successively and to be progressively coordinated with each other in order to ensure the efficient constructions of VJU.",
    "The surrounding environments of VJU would be also so important that those factors would be as in the followings. (1) The campus of the University should not be enclosed with fences and the security inside the buildings should be secured. (2) The campus should be covered so plenty of flowers and trees as to feel the change of Hanoi s four seasons in the nature. (3) Comfortable Japanese gardens with ponds should be located putting lotus flowers of both Japanese and Vietnamese as a symbol. (4) People and vehicles should be separated clearly and the space for people should be barrier-free. (5) Enough space should be provided for people to exercise and to refresh themselves even in bad weather (6) The campus should be resistant to various disasters such as floods and storms. (7) The space for children should be provided appropriately. (8) Facilities and Equipment of various sports should be provided. (9) The reliable, rapid and safe transportation system to from the Hanoi central should be established. 21(10) People should be able to communicate in Vietnamese, Japanese and English.",
    "5.3 Campus and Facilities As to the land of VJU for buildings, facilities and related properties, whose scale would be affected by its location, shape and surrounding environments, it should be secured as in the followings. (1) In HHTP (Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park), 60 ha and more of land would be expected to be secured 20ha of land for the university use (later the space would be diverted additionally to the use for Industry-academia collaboration), 20 ha of land for Industry-academia collaboration, human resource training lands, establishments of companies research institutes and other relevant private investments, and 20 ha of land for sports ground, parking lots and others (2) In the VNU relocation site, 60 ha and more of land would be expected to be secured 30 ha of land for the building and facilities for the purpose of the education and research of the University, 20 ha of land for sports ground and parks, 10ha of land for parking lots and others. (3) In the satellite campus of the Hanoi central, 2 to 5 ha of land would be expected to be secured.",
    "More details will be clarified in the result of the coming survey (and in the FS survey also) based on more opinions of related people, specific needs of companies, students and more relevant organizations. 22(Table) Buildings, Facilities and other Properties of Vietnam-Japan University Sizes of Floors( ) and (Lands ha ) Items ＨＨＴＰ ＶＮＵ The satellite campus in the Hanoi central Headquarter of VJU including a Museum, Facilities for 10000 Trainees, etc. Buildings and Facilities for the undergraduates 40000 Buildings and Facilities for the graduates 10000 20000 Satellite Campus in the Hanoi central 30000 (Land 2 4ha) E-Library 24- hours-open 5000 10000 5000 Student Communication Centers including Restaurants, 5000 10000 5000 Meeting- Rooms, Shops and others Center of Industry-Academia Collaboration 5000 Center of New-Businesses and Industrial-developments 10000 University Hall including an Auditorium and Halls for Big 10000 10000 Events and Meeting Science and Technology Museum for the Youth Facilities for Sports such as Tennis, Basket-Ball, Swimming 10000 and other athletics Accommodations and Dormitories for Researchers, 20000 20000 Lecturers, Specialists, Students other relevant people Facilities for Industry-academia collaboration, Research (Land 10ha ) and others mainly by private investments Park Area (20ha) (Land 20ha) (0 1ha) Playgrounds and Fields for various sports, Parking lots and (10ha) (10ha) others Total 75000 120000 40000 (Land 60ha ) (Land 60ha ) (Land 2 5ha) (Note) HHTP site in Hoa-Lac High-Tech Park.",
    "VNU site in VNU relocation area. 236. Administration, Management and Finance of Vietnam-Japan University 6.1 Administration Management and Finance of the Establishment Cost The Administration and Management of Vietnam-Japan University will be promoted by the VJU Secretariat and the Japanese Universities which will have the responsibilities for some parts of the University curriculum under the University Council composed of both countries. The University will be under the umbrella of VNU-Hanoi, but should be independently managed to keep its fiscal sustainability in the market over a long period of time. Therefore, the University should secure broad option in its administration and management based on the autonomy in the areas of education, scientific and technological surveys research, organizational structure, use of funds and international relations, and additionally in regards to personnel managements, financing, highly qualified human resource training and hosting of various events and so on. The fund for the establishment and starting of VJU will be estimated to amount to around billion yen. It will be (1) billion yen to the construction of the buildings and facilities and to the developments of surrounding environments, (2) billion yen to the current expenses for the management and operation of the University in total for the first 6 to 7 years, (3) billion yen to the training of the University staff and to the supports of students in total for the first 6 to 7 years.",
    "Considering the scale of the University, only the construction costs of the buildings and facilities over a projected period of 10 years will be estimated to amount to between 30 and 40 billion yen. After the starting of the University, it would take 3 to 4 years to get a proper prospect for its sustainable development keeping the constructions of the buildings and facilities. In the meantime, VJU should make a clearer outlook of the income-and-expenditure balance, and should seek for a proper path to the target of the constructions, judging from various conditions such as the land for the University, the supports investments of private companies and the development of surrounding investments. The income-and-expenditure balance of the University will be so affected by the situations of the broadness of the land acquired, the developments of industry-academia collaboration, and the supports and investments of private companies that the University should promote its constructions by active securing of income, expansion of supporters and positive acceptance of private investments. 6.2 Vietnam-Japan University Fund To support the construction of Vietnam-Japan University and to promote the sustainable development and smooth running of its activities, the establishment of the Vietnam-Japan University fund (hereinafter referred to as VJU Fund) will be proposed.",
    "VJU Fund would be 24considered to be established as a NPO (non-profit organization) or a SPC (Special Purpose Company). VJU Fund and Vietnam-Japan University, which will sign a cooperation agreement, will support the constructions and current running of VJU, as well as the training of highly qualified specialists and technical experts, the promotion of industry-academia collaboration, the construction of laboratories, the securing of supports and investments of private companies and related services. The University might be imposed various institutional restrictions on its activities, so we would propose to set up the Fund. VJU Fund will fundamentally have the Board, the Supervisor (a leader, CEO) and the Secretariat. The Board will consist of the members such as the core members of VJU Council and investors of both countries, while the Secretariat will be consisted by the staff of both countries depending on their investments. A powerful decision-making body should be established to ensure the smooth progress of the construction and developments of the University. VJU Fund should not be a permanent entity and, at the final stage of the University construction plan, the related businesses will be separated (to be entrusted to the Government Agencies or to be sold to private parties) and at the end of this project, only its administrative functions (namely the University fund of human resource developments) will be expected to be left.",
    "The exit policy should be determined based on the market-oriented considerations. VJU Fund will be responsible not only for the expansion of human resource training, but it will also promote activities aiming at enhancing the University s dynamism and attractiveness. For example, we can suggest the planning and holding of the sports competitions such as soccer-tournaments as well as the planning and management of the Youth Science-and-Technology events. 6.3 Financial Plan and Prospects of Income and Expenditure With regard to the University s financial plan, the financial plan and budget outlook for the next 10 years should be formulated and should be subject to yearly revisions according to the actual result (so called, a rolling-plan). The University should consider its constructions and managements in 3 to 4 years later than the establishment-and-starting, principally based on that the sustainable profit of a single year can be secured in near future. The fiscal balance of the University will be affected by several factors such as (1) the scale of facilities and equipment, (2) the scale and contents of curriculum, and various services of the University, (3) the securing of lands, (4) the supports and investments of private companies, (5) the setting of tuitions and (6) the Governments supports.",
    "25The cost of constructions and maintenance of the buildings and facilities will be covered initially with ODA and the preparation of land, following with financing, investments, financial supports and donations of the Governments, private companies and other organizations. In the medium and long term, the cost should be covered by the Governments supports, revenue from related services, asset-income from the buildings and facilities, sponsorships and investments of private companies and so on. The operating cost of the University (costs of employment, education and research, etc.) will be covered initially by the Governments subsidies, ODA, supports and cooperation of private companies, and in the long-term, the cost should be covered by the supports and cooperation of the Governments, charges for use of the facilities and others, revenue from related services and supports of VJU Fund and companies as well as the tuition fees. Taking into consideration of the tuition levels of universities in Vietnam, tuition fees of VJU should be kept as low as possible according to the concept of the University. However, when offering high-level advanced services, the prices (tuition fees, user fees, etc.)",
    "should be set to meet the quality of services, and it would be so rational to provide some reductions and financial supports under certain conditions such as income level and personal difficulties. The issue will be considered continuously.

In addition to the land, ODA funds, acquisitions of equity investments and donations, there might be several projects to be proposed for the sustainable developments of VJU as in the followings.",
    "(1) Education and Research of the University Holding of Titled Courses of companies, Sponsorship of Companies for establishments of the specific graduate courses and for hosting symposiums, etc., and Scholarships of the Governments, private companies and relevant organizations, (2) Invite of Private Investments by offering advanced excellent environments of living and education-and-research Establishments of the Specific Graduate Courses, Establishments of the Organizations of Human Resource Training and Recruiting and Supports for the Developments in HHTP, (3) Offer of Human Resource Training services Japanese Language Courses, various Practical Trainings and Internships, (4) Related Business Activities long-term and short-term Accommodation Facilities, Dormitories for trainees and students, related Sports Facilities, Implementation of various Events, (5) Use of Properties Sale of Name Rights of Facilities and others mainly for Japanese companies, (6) Academic and Policy Programs of the Japanese and Vietnamese Governments. 27VJU projects should be reconsidered in 3 to 4 years later than its starting, and then should totally check the management, the income-and-expenditure prospect, and the surrounding environments of the University in order to reconstruct its construction plan then.",
    "7. Opening of Vietnam-Japan University 7.1 Establishment of Vietnam-Japan Graduate School of Sustainability (a tentative name) For the opening of Vietnam-Japan University in 2016, Vietnam-Japan Graduate School of Sustainability (a tentative name) would be established under VNU-Hanoi. The significance of Sustainability has been fully recognized in the Vietnam s Socio-Economic Development Strategy, so the graduate school would be established to educate research the issues such as Global Environments, Climate Change, Disaster Control, Sustainable Developments of Regions and International Public Policies comprehensively. At the beginning, the school would start as the graduate school with the master s course of 2 years (the first term of the doctoral course) and the doctoral degrees (the latter term of the doctoral course) would be prepared with the measures such as studying at the graduate schools in Japan and the establishment of the joint degree programs. In addition to studying at the doctoral course, the target of the graduate school will be comprehensively to grow up the students to leading politicians, government s officials, leading executives specialists of companies including Japanese companies, excellent experts and entrepreneurs.",
    "7.2 Curriculum of the Graduate School The graduate school will offer the 2-year master s courses and all students will be requested to take the International Liberal Arts course to learn the general basic knowledge which will support to develop their special researches in the future. The International Liberal Arts course will focus on the broad liberal arts education expanding student s perspectives, the special basic educations connecting Vietnamese undergraduate education with Japanese master s course, and the active learning inspiring active attitudes for learnings. The students will learn the languages of Japanese and Vietnamese (if needed, including English) in the course. This International Liberal Arts course would provide a foothold for the future extending of the liberal arts education to the undergraduate level (see Reference). 28 Reference Subjects (examples) of the International Liberal Arts course Subjects of History and Japanology would be required to learn obligatorily. Subjects of History Vietnamese History, Oriental History Subjects of Japanology Affairs of Modern Economies Affairs of Modern Business Managements Subjects of Economic theories Macro Economics Micro Economics Subjects of Managements Management, Marketing Subjects of Laws International Private Laws, Intellectual Properties The following 4 special courses composed of 2 courses of Humanities Social Science and 2 courses of Natural Science, would be established in the graduate school.",
    "In the middle of the 2020s, 4 Schools Faculties, Engineering and Technology and Medical-care, Nursing-care, Medicine and Life-Sciences for Natural Science and Humanities, Area Studies, Regional Societies and Policy Sciences and Economics, Management, Laws Public Policies for Humanities Social Science, would be established.

Advanced Mechanical Engineering Automobile, Electronic Machineries, Robots, Railway, Shipbuilding, etc. New Material Irons, Chemistries, New Materials, etc. 29Reference 7.3 Students and University Staff of the Graduate School In the starting of VJU, each of the 4 courses will admit 20 applicants every year, and then the students of the graduate school will be about 80 persons in total for each grade. As for the University staff, The Japanese universities will dispatch 10 professors lecturers for the International Liberal Arts course and 5-10 people for each special course about 40 people in total (see a note)). VJU will have the schedule to increase special courses and subjects of lectures successively, and in 6 to 7 years later, the University will have a total enrollment of more than 1000 students mainly composed of the graduate students, especially 300 students yearly for the master s course.",
    "On dispatching Japanese staff to VJU, it might be better to apply the long-term expert dispatch system of JICA or the like for the time being until the system receiving them will be established. In addition, it would be able to increase the staff in association with private companies and in accordance with the investments increased step-by-step. (Note) The Japanese staff of VJU at its starting (Image) 5 persons for each special course excluding the Life and Environmental Science course (about 15 persons in total for 3 special courses) 5 persons a professor, an associate professor, an assistant professor and 2 research associates 30 About 10 persons for the Life and Environmental Science course 10 persons 2 professors, 2 associate professors, 2 assistant professors and 4 research associates About 10 persons for the International Liberal Arts Professors 1 for History, 1 for Economy, 1 for Management, 1 for Laws and 1 for Public Policy Assistant professors 1 for History, 1 for Economy, 1 for Management, 1 for Laws and 1 for Public Policy 7.4 Establishment of the Japanese Language Educational Institute VJU will establish the Japanese language educational institute.",
    "The institute will have the night classes of Japanese Language for the students of the school before and after their enrollment to the school, and will intensively strengthen their abilities of Japanese Language. The educational staff of the school will be tentatively 5 persons for the admittances of 80 persons. However, under the strong demand for Japanese language education of the human resource development of Vietnam-Japan University, and of Japanese companies, the staff would be increased probably. 7.5 Training of the University Staff VJU should be on the administration and management of Vietnamese staff in the cooperation with the Japanese universities and Japanese companies as early as possible. Therefore, it will be necessary to promote several activities such as the studying-in-Japan program of the University staff engaging in education, research and managements, the middle long-term trainings and the improvements of training circumstances including ICT Remote Lectures Seminars, an E-Library construction and industry-academia collaborations. As to the Promotion of industry-academia collaboration especially, there would be a lot of research themes such as the developments of supporting industries, the promotion of sight-seeing industries and the establishment of distribution systems.",
    "7.6 Training of Highly Qualified Specialists and Technical Experts and Supports for their Employments VJU will undertake the training of highly qualified specialists and technical experts, and the supports for their employments, based on the needs of Japanese companies and on the Vietnamese needs of the society and students in cooperation with the current training programs and personnel training organizations. The specific details would be clarified in the coming study and in the next feasibility study. 318. Construction Plan of Vietnam-Japan University 8.1 Outline VJU will be established as the University with the graduate school. The construction of the University will be scheduled by dividing the target period of about 10 years into three stages. In the first stage, the feasibility study will be immediately carried out in details and the master s course (the first period of the doctoral course) of the graduate school named Vietnam-Japan Graduate School of Sustainability (a tentative name), will be established in three years as the core of VJU. In association with VNU-Hanoi, VJU will begin its activities as in the followings. (1) Preparations for the coming units and graduate-courses by each research-group, or by professor, or by course, (2) Establishment of the systems and circumstances for education and research allowing effective works of professors, lecturers and other staff of the University, (3) Recruiting and fostering of eligible professors and lecturers of Japan and Vietnam, (4) Training of highly qualified specialists and technical experts, (5) Promotion of the supports and relevant investments of companies and organizations.",
    "Utilizing the Japanese education programs such as Twinning System, Double Degree and advancement to the doctoral courses, the small graduate school will be establish at the early stage, then later the school will be soon expanded to the University with undergraduate courses. In the next 3 to 4 years (the second stage), VJU will establish the latter term of the doctoral courses and some undergraduate courses to be the full university with the graduate school. In this stage, the requirements for sustainable developments of VJU, such as the income-and-expenditure prospects, the situation of Land prepared, the supports and investments of the Governments and private companies, and the specific needs of students and companies, will be clarified, so the construction plan of the University should be seriously examined from a viewpoint of its sustainable development in the market. In this period, the University staff will be supposed to be replaced with Vietnamese as many as possible. Concerning the further development of VJU, VJU would be necessary to decide in this occasion (1) if it would maintain develop the original plan and would continue further investments, or (2) if it would maintain the current situation and would watch for the opportunity of further developments, or (3) if would be set back to merge with VNU or to take the students to the Japanese Universities.",
    "There would be almost no possibility to get 32the last situation, but might be left some possibility in the cases of the emergence of other universities with better managements, or in the case of the bad managements of VJU. According to the plan, at latest in the last three years (in the third stage) some Japanese Universities would collaborate to establish four schools faculties based on their own administrations and managements in fields of Natural Sciences and Humanities Social Sciences. 8.2 Construction Plan (1) The first stage Opening VJ Graduate School of Sustainability (the master s courses or the first term of the doctoral courses) It will be immediately necessary to carry out a feasibility study for the establishment of VJ Graduate School of Sustainability in three years. For the purpose of the establishment of the doctoral courses and the faculties, related lectures and seminars will be started and practical human resource trainings will also be held for high-level specialists and technical experts. The school will be started in the rented flat of the building in Hanoi central. At the same time the constructions of the satellite campus in Hanoi central and of the campus in Hoa-Lac Hi-Tech Park (HHTP), and possibly in the relocation site of VNU-Hanoi also, will be started.",
    "The graduate school will start with 160 students (the quota) of the master s courses and with around 40 persons of professors and lecturers. (2) The second stage Establishment of the full doctoral courses and of small undergraduate schools The full courses of doctoral program and small undergraduate schools will be established depending on the needs of students and Japanese companies and on the line-up of the University staff until 6 or 7 years later. Upgrading a variety of high-level human resource development programs, expanding the training courses, opening industry-academia collaboration facilities including companies research institutions, and financial supports and investments of Japanese companies will be promoted. In this period, the satellite campus in Hanoi central and the campus in HHTP will be progressively constructed and will be put into use, and the shuttle bus service will be started. While in the beginning stage of the graduate school, the school will be located at the satellite campus and HHTP campus, its functions of education and research will be moved to the VNU campus upon the completion of preparing the campus in Hoa Lac, and the 33HHTP campus will be assigned to the functions such as industry-academia collaborations, research institutions, human resource developments and companies R D investments.",
    "The number of students will amount to 1000 2000 including more than 700 post-graduates, and then the Graduate Schools of Natural Science and of Humanities Social Sciences will have been fully established. The requirements for the sustainable development of VJU such as the income-and-expenditure prospects, the situation of the land, the supports and investments of the Governments and private companies and the needs of students and companies, will be clarified, so the construction plan of the University should be reviewed from a viewpoint of the sustainable developments. (3) The third stage Achieving the original goal Assuming the progress of construction of VJU as scheduled, a total of 4 schools faculties (2 for humanities social sciences, and 2 for natural sciences) would be established. The relevant facilities such as industry-academia cooperation facilities and research institutions would be also constructed and a variety of high-level human resource development programs and training courses would have been developed to mid-2020. In this time, the visits of Japanese students and experts of various fields would be increased and various symposiums and lectures will be held frequently. The satellite campus in Hanoi central should be developed to the center of those activities and events.",
    "As for the facilities of VJU, all of the VNU HHTP campus in Hoa-Lac and the satellite campus in the Hanoi central would be in operation. Then the number of students will amount to about 6,000 persons including 2,400 persons of postgraduates and to about 300 persons of professors and lecturers and about 200 persons of the University staff. (Reference) The Construction Plan of Japan-Vietnam University 349. Expected Outcome of Vietnam-Japan University The Vietnam-Japan University project is the grand vision, which will contribute in the cooperation of Politicians, the Governments, Universities and Companies to (1) the Establishment of the World-class Leading University with the graduate school and its leading human resource developments, (2) the Practical Trainings of highly qualified Specialists, Technical Experts and companies executives, (3) the Promotion of Private Investments mainly of Japanese companies, (4) the Establishment of Advanced Living Environments and (5) the Developments of VNU, Hanoi and Hoa-Lac Hi-Tech Park, and which will be along the Vietnamese Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2011-2020. At first, VJU will develop creative human resources who will have the equivalent level of broad knowledge to the students of Japanese leading universities in various fields.",
    "This will lead to develop the leaders who will have cross-sectional networks of various societies including between Japan and Vietnam. Secondly, VJU will broadly develop highly qualified practical human resources of specialists, technical-experts and corporate executives based on the needs of Vietnamese students and the companies mainly of Japanese ones. Those will be such as (1) the participations of companies, industrial executives and engineers into academic activities of the University, (2) the research and business activities on Industry-academia collaboration, and (3) supports for recruitment of companies. Thirdly, concerning the promotion of private investments mainly of Japanese companies, VJU may appeal the features in the specific fields such as the treatment for the demand of high-level human resources, the providing of comfortable safe advanced living environments to business executives and technical experts and the most favorable place to facilitate the joint R D business-development projects between Japan and Vietnam. Fourthly, providing advanced living environments would be just the purpose which the University should seek for. The people living there will form the global leading community not only in the academic societies but also in the practical societies. Fifthly, needless to say, VJU will surely contribute to the developments of VNU, Hanoi and Hoa-Lac Hi-Tech Park and of Vietnam. 35It is also essentially important for Japan and Japanese companies to share thoughts globally and to develop our societies together with Vietnam and Vietnamese when we have been facing the tidal waves of the globalization and various drastic changes in the international environments. In this meaning, Vietnam-Japan University should be developed soon into the University where many Japanese students can also learn in near future. We ve convinced the huge contribution of the VJU project not only for Vietnamese socio-economic developments but also for the reinforcement and developments of the relationships between Japan and Vietnam. 36"
