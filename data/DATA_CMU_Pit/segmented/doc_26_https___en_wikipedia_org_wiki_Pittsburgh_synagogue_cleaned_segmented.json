    "The congregation, along with New Light Congregation and Congregation Dor Hadash, which also worshipped in the building, was attacked during Shabbat morning services. The perpetrator killed eleven people and wounded six, in the deadliest attack on a local Jewish community in American history. 7 The perpetrator, 46-year-old Robert Gregory Bowers, 8 was shot multiple times by police and arrested at the scene. 9 Bowers had earlier posted antisemitic comments against HIAS (formerly, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) on the online alt-tech social network Gab. 10 11 12 Dor Hadash 13 had participated in HIAS s National Refugee Shabbat the previous week. Referring to Central American migrant caravans and immigrants, Bowers posted a message on Gab in which he wrote that HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I m going in. 14 He was charged with 63 federal crimes, some of them capital crimes. 9 Bowers pleaded not guilty. 9 In 2023, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death by lethal injection.",
    "15 Background edit Tree of Life Or L Simcha Congregation is a Conservative Jewish synagogue. The synagogue describes itself as a traditional, progressive, and egalitarian congregation. 16 It is located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of downtown Pittsburgh. 16 17 The Squirrel Hill neighborhood is one of the largest predominantly Jewish neighborhoods in the United States and has historically been the center of Pittsburgh s Jewish community. About 26 percent of the city s Jewish population live in the area. 18 19 20 Originally founded as an Orthodox Jewish congregation in 1864 in downtown Pittsburgh, by an early group of Jewish immigrants, Tree of Life merged in 2010 with the recently founded Congregation Or L Simcha. 21 The modern synagogue building, located at the intersection of Wilkins and Shady avenues in Squirrel Hill, was built in 1953. The congregation also rents space to Dor Hadash, c a Reconstructionist congregation and New Light, another Conservative congregation. 22 23 24 The synagogue s main sanctuary has a capacity of 1,250 people. 25 Squirrel Hill has a low crime rate and is not generally regarded as racially tense.",
    "However, local rabbinic student Neal Rosenblum was murdered in the neighborhood in 1986 in an antisemitic hate crime. 26 This 2018 mass shooting took place soon after Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League independently reported a spike in antisemitic activity online, especially on the popular social networking platforms Instagram and Twitter. 27 28 29 30 In addition, other antisemitic acts had been committed elsewhere. 31 The immediate rise in the months of August to October 2018 was attributed to rising tensions associated with advertising for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. 32 A similar rise in online attacks had occurred during the 2016 US election, 27 with the midterms being a rallying point for far-right extremists to organize efforts to spread antisemitism online among the populace. 28 In 2017, there was a 57 rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States, 30 29 in context of rising hate crimes against other groups, including Muslims and African Americans, as reported by the FBI. 30 For instance, hundreds of Jewish gravestones were vandalized in Pennsylvania and Missouri, 28 and antisemitic incidents on university campuses doubled in number.",
    "31 In August 2017, the widely publicized Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia featured Nazi symbols, salutes, and the slogan Blood and Soil, 31 among other racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Considerable antisemitic material was being spread online via conspiracy theories about wealthy Jewish individuals, including billionaire George Soros. Columbia University s Jon Albright said that these represented the worst sample of all the hate speech he had seen on Instagram. 27 Shooting edit At 9 45 a.m. EDT (13 45 UTC ), three religious services were underway in the Tree of Life synagogue, which housed three distinct congregations. Tree of Life and New Light had both begun independent Shabbat morning service in the Pervin Chapel 33 and basement, respectively. The Dor Hadash congregants were gathered near the front of the building, prior to their 10 00 a.m. Torah study session. 34 Five minutes later, a gunman, identified as Robert Bowers and described as a bearded heavy-set white male, entered the building, opened fire and was shooting for about 20 minutes. 35 He was armed with a Colt AR-15 semi-automatic rifle (cited by authorities as an assault rifle ) 3 and three Glock.357 SIG semi-automatic pistols, all four of which he fired, according to authorities.",
    "7 36 17 37 There would typically be around 75 people in the building on a Saturday morning. 33 The first two persons shot were two brothers, Cecil and David Rosenthal, at the main entrance, after which Bowers headed downstairs to New Light. Some hearing the shots did not initially recognize them for what they were Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, located upstairs, thought a coat rack had fallen and clattered. 38 By 9 54, police began receiving multiple calls from people barricaded in the building and reporting the attack. 39 40 41 At 9 55, 42 Melvin Wax, the leader of New Light s services, hid in a pitch-black closet in the basement. He opened the door of the closet, and Bowers immediately shot him. The latter did not notice the other three congregants who remained in the closet. Two other members of New Light, Gottfried and Stein, were shot and killed in the basement kitchen. 33 Bowers also killed Jerry Rabinowitz of Dor Hadash, a physician who had gone toward the sound of gunshots to see if anyone had been hurt.",
    "33 At 9 57, 42 Bowers left the basement and headed upstairs to the larger Tree of Life service. About 13 worshippers had gathered for the Shabbat service in an upstairs chapel. Myers helped four of them evacuate the chapel through a side door, but eight of the worshippers remained behind. Bowers killed seven of them and wounded the eighth. 33 43 Police sources said Bowers shouted at some point during the attack, All Jews must die! 39 44 At 9 59, police arrived at the synagogue. 40 45 Bowers fired on police from the entryway while apparently departing, and police returned fire, forcing him to retreat into the building. 33 46 A half-hour later, tactical teams entered the building, and Bowers also fired upon them. When officers wounded him in return fire, he retreated to the third floor and hid in a room. 40 He had wounded two officers and two SWAT members, one of them critically. 46 At 11 08, Bowers crawled out of the room and surrendered, having been shot multiple times. 47 As he received medical care in police custody, he allegedly told a SWAT officer that he wanted Jews to die and that Jews were committing genocide against his people.",
    "48 Bowers discharged his rifle 67 times during the shooting. 49 Victims edit Memorials to victims outside the Tree of Life synagogue Plaque listing the victims names. By the 9 11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem Eleven people were killed, 50 51 52 including three on the ground level and four in the synagogue s basement. 53 Among the dead were two brothers and a married couple. 35 54 At least six others were injured, including four Pittsburgh Police officers. 55 39 Five people were transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, four requiring surgery, while one was treated and released by the afternoon. Another victim was transported to UPMC Mercy, while the accused was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. 56 Those killed were Joyce Fienberg, 75, a retired University of Pittsburgh research specialist Richard Gottfried, 65, a dentist Rose Mallinger, 97, an active congregant at the synagogue for more than 60 years Jerry Rabinowitz, 65, a family physician Cecil, 59 David Rosenthal, 54, brothers who lived together at a community home for people with disabilities Bernice, 84 Sylvan Simon, 86, a retired couple who celebrated their wedding at Tree of Life in 1956 Daniel Stein, 71, a retired salesman and substitute school teacher Melvin Wax, 87, a retired accountant who was leading services at the time of the shooting Irving Younger, 69, a retired real estate company owner, who served as a greeter at the synagogue Seven others were injured in the incident, which included three other congregants and four Pittsburgh officers (two patrol officers and two SWAT officers three by ricocheted gunfire and another by glass fragments).",
    "33 Perpetrator edit Robert Bowers (born September 4, 1972), 57 a resident of Baldwin, Pennsylvania, was arrested as the shooter. 58 59 60 Bowers parents divorced when he was about one year old. 61 While Bowers was seven years old, his father, Randall G. Bowers of the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Garfield, died by suicide on October 15, 1979 at the age of 26 while he was awaiting trial on a rape charge in connection of an April 27, 1979 rape of a 20-year-old woman in Squirrel Hill. 61 62 63 Authorities confirmed that his body, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest, was found under a picnic table near the Tionesta Dam in Tionesta, Pennsylvania with antidepressant drugs next to him. Police also recovered his.22 caliber rifle at the scene. 64 Bowers s mother was remarried in 1975, with the family briefly living in Florida before the couple separated the following year in 1976. 61 Upon their return to Pennsylvania, Bowers and his mother lived with his mother s parents in Whitehall, a suburb of Pittsburgh.",
    "His maternal grandparents took responsibility for raising him because his mother suffered from health problems. 61 Bowers attended Baldwin High School in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District from August 1986 to November 1989. He dropped out of high school before graduation and worked as a trucker for 13 years until 2002. 65 66 Neighbors described Bowers as a ghost who rarely interacted with others. 58 According to accounts which were given by Bowers coworkers, and analysis of his recent social media posts, his conservatism became radicalized as white nationalism at one point in the late-1990s, Bowers was fascinated by the right-wing radio host Jim Quinn, who at the time was on WRRK. 67 At a later time, he became a follower of aggressive online provocateurs of the right wing s fringe. 68 He was deeply involved in posting comments on social media websites such as Gab and he also promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories on them. 69 Bowers routinely discussed a conspiracy theory that Jews were assisting evil Muslims to take over the United States together. 70 At the same time, he accused ISIS of being a Jewish terrorist group and said the Islamic State beheadings were ritual murders of Christians.",
    "71 Gab has been described as friendly to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the alt-right. 72 Bowers registered his Gab profile in January 2018 under the handle onedingo he described his account by the following Jews are the children of Satan ( John 8 44 ). The Lord Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. The cover picture was a photo with the number 1488, which is used by neo-Nazis and white supremacists to evoke David Lane s Fourteen Words and the Nazi slogan Heil Hitler. Bowers published posts that supported the white genocide conspiracy theory, such as one that said, Daily Reminder Diversity means chasing down the last white person. 73 Bowers said that supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory were deluded and being tricked. 74 75 76 Bowers was very active on social media, posting his own similar antisemitic and racist rants. He often re-posted content by other similarly minded users, such as Patrick Little, who expressed antisemitic, neo-Nazi, white nationalist supremacist thoughts and denied the Holocaust. In addition, he reposted comments in support of the four men behind the beating of DeAndre Harris and the Southern California -based alt-right fight club Rise Above Movement (RAM) in the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.",
    "RAM was later arrested by the FBI and convicted at trial for violence against counter-demonstrators. Bowers also posted comments in support of the Western chauvinist Proud Boys led by Gavin McInnes, who were arrested the same month for engaging in a fight with Antifa outside the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City. 77 78 79 80 81 82 His posts on Gab mentioned that he was initially a supporter of US president Donald Trump. 77 Bowers felt that Trump was not extreme enough, and he criticized him as globalist, not a nationalist 83 and suggested Trump was being controlled by Jews. 84 Bowers also denounced African Americans with racial slurs and images which are related to lynchings, and he also denounced white women who have relationships with Black men. 85 He used his online accounts to post conspiracy theories regarding philanthropist George Soros. 86 The Times said that security sources had alleged that Bowers had links to the far-right and neo-Nazis in the United Kingdom. 87 A month before the attack, Bowers posted photos of results of his target practice. He also posted a photo of his three handguns, calling them his glock family.",
    "80 In the post, he identified the.357 SIG handguns as Glock 31, Glock 32, and Glock 33. 79 Bowers coordinated with Brad Griffin (aka Hunter Wallace) of Occidental Dissent, an alt-right associated blogger and member of League of the South on doxxing an unidentified left-wing blogger. Bowers wrote that address is not the most current for him. I can get you the most recent outside of gab. 88 League of the South was one of the organizations that participated in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville. 88 In the weeks before the shooting, Bowers made antisemitic posts directed at the HIAS -sponsored 11 12 National Refugee Shabbat 89 of October 19 20, in which Dor Hadash 13 participated. He claimed Jews were aiding members of Central American caravans moving toward the United States border and referred to those migrants as invaders. 10 Shortly before the attack, he posted on Gab that HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I m going in.",
    "51 90 60 According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the mention of optics references a disagreement that has raged within the white nationalist movement since the Unite the Right rally in 2017 about how best to get their message across to the general public. 91 After the shooting, Gab suspended Bowers s profile and pledged to cooperate with the criminal investigation. 74 82 Shortly after the attack, PayPal, Stripe, Joyent, and Medium pulled their support for Gab, and GoDaddy, under which the Gab domains were registered, required Gab to relocate their domain name hosting to a different service, effectively shutting Gab down in the short term. 92 Criminal charges and proceedings edit Federal criminal proceedings edit Indictment and pretrial proceedings edit Bowers was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with 29 federal crimes. 36 93 Bowers appeared in federal court in Pittsburgh on October 29, 2018, and was ordered held without bail pending trial. 94 Two days later, Bowers was indicted on 44 counts by a federal grand jury. The charges carry a maximum penalty of death or 535 years in federal prison.",
    "95 The counts included hate crimes, 96 11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer, and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. 35 93 97 98 On November 1, 2018, Bowers entered a plea of not guilty. 99 On January 29, 2019, the grand jury indicted Bowers on an additional 19 counts, 13 of which were for hate crimes. 100 On February 11, 2019, Bowers was arraigned in federal court. 9 Bowers s defense team includes two public defenders plus well-known criminal defense attorney Judy Clarke, a death penalty expert who was appointed by the court as co-counsel for the defendant. 9 101 The defense offered a plea deal in which Bowers would plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without parole federal prosecutors declined, seeking the death penalty instead. 101 102 103 The trial date was not set until various pretrial motions were resolved.",
    "103 104 In April 2020, Senior U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose denied a defense challenge to the federal death penalty. 101 In October 2020, Judge Ambrose denied a defense motion to dismiss charges brought under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and Church Arson Prevention Act. 101 In November 2021, the defense decided that it would not pursue an insanity defense or intellectual disability defense. 105 In January 2022, after holding an earlier evidentiary hearing, Judge Ambrose denied Bowers s motion to suppress evidence of statements he made after being arrested by police, inside an ambulance, and at the hospital the day of the attack. 106 After Judge Ambrose retired in February 2022, the case was randomly reassigned to U.S. District Judge Robert J. Colville. 107 In March 2022, Colville denied Bowers s motion for a change of venue. 108 Trial edit In September 2022, Judge Colville set the trial to begin in April 2023, rejecting a bid by the defense to delay the trial until December 2023. 109 In March 2023, members of the jury pool began completing questionnaires. 110 The jury selection process began on April 24 with twelve jurors and six alternates being selected.",
    "111 112 The trial began May 30, 2023. 113 114 Prosecutors called sixty witnesses, while the defense did not call any witnesses. 115 The witnesses who testified included survivors of the attack, including congregants and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. 115 Evidence presented to the jury included recordings of 9-1-1 calls as the attacks unfolded (including from some of the people killed), and testimony from police officers who ultimately subdued the gunman from expert witnesses on medicine, guns, and computers from the FBI agents and police detectives who investigated the case from a paramedic who responded to the scene and from the director of the Allegheny County Medical Examiner s Office. 115 116 Photographs were also introduced as evidence, 115 including photos of exhaustively documented bloodstains, bullet fragments, and shell casings, and police body-worn camera footage was also shown to the jury. 116 Bowers s antisemitic social media posts were also introduced as evidence. 117 After 11 days of testimony, prosecutors told the jury in closing argument that Bowers had made cold, calculated, deliberate choices in the shooting. 117 Bowers s defense counsel conceded that he had fatally shot all the victims, but argued that there was doubt as to his specific intent why he did what he did and what he thought he would accomplish by doing so.",
    "117 On June 16, 2023, 50-year-old Bowers was found guilty on all 63 federal charges, including 11 counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death the jury rendered its verdict after five hours of deliberation over two days. 118 Sentencing phase edit The sentencing phase began on June 16, 2023, with the jury hearing arguments to decide if Bowers should be sentenced to death or life without parole. Bowers defense lawyers sought to persuade the jury that Bowers had significant brain damage 119 and was influenced by mental illness or delusions. 120 121 By contrast, prosecutors emphasized evidence showing that Bowers had extensively planned his attack and was motivated by antisemitism, 119 120 as shown in his numerous rants on social media and statements to police after the attack. 121 Three University of Pittsburgh Medical Center physicians (two radiologists and a neurologist) testified about their review of brain-imaging tests (an EEG, PET, and MRI ) of Bowers in 2021 and 2022. 119 They found the tests to be largely normal. 119 121 Two defense experts, by contrast, testified that they believed Bowers had significant brain damage that could be correlated with schizophrenia and could affect behavior.",
    "119 A separate defense expert, a University of North Texas forensic psychologist, testified on his opinions from 20 hours of examination of Bowers over four days in 2022. He testified that Bowers was proud of his attack, showed no remorse for the shooting, and thought that he deserved medals and a parade. 120 The psychologist opined that Bowers is blatantly psychotic and suffers from schizophrenia, but agreed on cross-examination that he was goal-oriented and planned the attack as much as six months in advance. 120 Separately, a neurologist who examined Bowers in 2021 testified as a defense expert, opining that Bowers had schizophrenia and epilepsy. 121 On cross-examination, the defense neurologist acknowledged that Bowers was not incapable of plotting the shootings, but testified that his reasons for planning it out are unreliable in his brain. 121 The defense presented evidence of Bowers s lengthy history of serious mental illness, including multiple suicide attempts since his teenage years, an incident in which he threw flammable liquid on his mother and tried to ignite it at age thirteen, and three instances of involuntary commitment, the latest in 2004.",
    "121 At the request of the defense, the sentencing phase was split into two parts (each with its own opening statements, closing arguments and jury decision) (1) whether Bowers was eligible to be sentenced to death and (2) the selection of the sentence. On July 13, 2023, after two hours of deliberation, the jury found that Bowers was eligible for a death sentence. 122 After making further deliberation on sentence for two days, the federal jury issued a unanimous decision to sentence Bowers to the death penalty on August 2. 123 Bowers was the first and only criminal to be sentenced to death by the US federal government during the presidency of Joe Biden. 124 125 On August 3, 2023, Bowers was formally sentenced to death. 126 Imprisonment edit On August 26, 2023, Bowers was transferred to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and placed on death row at United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute. 127 Bowers attempted to appeal his sentence for a new trial in November 2023, 128 but his request was denied in May 2024.",
    "129 In December 2024, when President Joe Biden announced commutations for the death sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, he excluded Bowers along with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who perpetrated the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and Dylann Roof, who committed the 2015 Charleston church shooting, because of their convictions for either terrorism or hate-motivated mass murder related crimes. 130 State criminal proceedings edit Bowers was also charged with 36 state criminal counts, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, six counts of attempted criminal homicide, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. 36 The state charges were held in abeyance pending the federal trial. 96 Reactions edit United States edit National edit Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf makes a statement about the shooting. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto stands listening in the striped tie. President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, then-Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, and Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O Connor released statements about the incident through Twitter. Trump called the shooting a wicked, antisemitic act of pure evil.",
    "55 He also opined that the shooting was preventable If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him. 131 132 133 Trump suggested cases such as this call for the death penalty. 133 Cecilia Wang of the American Civil Liberties Union said the attack, along with other recent unrest, was inspired by elements of Trump s rhetoric. 134 Vice President Mike Pence denied any such connection in an NBC News interview that night. 135 136 Over 2,000 people, including many from the local Jewish community, protested against Trump s visit to the synagogue site, chanting words have meaning, and carrying signs with such slogans as We build bridges, not walls. 137 From October 27 to 31, all U.S. flags on public and military grounds were flown at half-staff in memory of the victims. 138 On the Friday following the shooting, David Shribman, executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ran the opening of the Hebrew - Aramaic kaddish, often called the Jewish mourner s prayer, as a full-width front-page headline. 139 Jewish security edit The aftermath of the shooting included arguably the most ambitious and comprehensive effort ever taken to protect Jewish life in the United States, according to the New York Times.",
    "In addition to bringing in 100 million in federal grants through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NGSP), the Jewish Federations of North America raised 62 million to secure every Jewish community in North America, overseen by the Secure Community Network. By 2023, 93 Jewish federations had full-time security directors, a more than four-fold increase over the previous 5 years. 140 The next year, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 83 of 2019 to establish the state s Nonprofit Security Grant Fund, a state-level version of the NGSP. Initially, 5 million in grant funding was available. After an increase in antisemitism during the Gaza war in 2023, the General Assembly increased the available funding to 10 million. 141 In the 5 years since its inception, the fund distributed 25 million to synagogues, mosques, and other nonprofit organizations. 142 Local edit Carnegie Mellon University lowered the American flag to half-staff to mourn the victims. People gathered again at the intersection of Forbes and Murray Avenues in front of the Sixth Presbyterian Church on October 30. On the same day, Trump visited Pittsburgh in response to the shooting incident.",
    "143 Immediately after the shooting, the campus of Carnegie Mellon University was placed on lockdown and all university-sponsored activities were cancelled for the day. 24 At the same time residents were advised by police to remain in their homes and stay off the streets. 53 An unusually large proportion of the Pittsburgh Jewish community from all denominations participated in local Jewish rituals related to death and mourning. Jewish tradition requires a person to guard a corpse until it is buried. Shomrim (volunteer guards) took one-hour shifts at the Pittsburgh morgue until the bodies were moved to funeral homes. The Atlantic reported that most of the volunteers appeared to be Orthodox, but they felt strong solidarity with the liberal communities that were directly affected by the shooting. 144 Members of the Pittsburgh Steelers attended the joint funeral service for the Rosenthal brothers on Tuesday, October 30, when NFL teams are traditionally off. The brothers, who were intellectually disabled, had a sister who is a former employee of the team. 145 During the long wait for a trial, members of the Pittsburgh congregations received interfaith support and solidarity from black church and American Sikh communities targeted by violent hatred, 146 including members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina (targeted by a shooting attack in 2015 ) 146 and the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin that had been targeted in a shooting attack in 2012.",
    "147 International edit The Eiffel Tower in Paris darkened its lights in tribute to the victims of the shooting. 148 Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the horrifying antisemitic brutality, adding the whole of Israel grieves with the families of the dead. 149 Israel s education and diaspora affairs minister, Naftali Bennett, immediately left for Pittsburgh to visit the synagogue, meet with community members, and participate in the funerals of the victims, 150 and directed the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs to assess and prepare to assist the Pittsburgh Jewish community, including the need for emergency and resilience teams that immediately left Israel for psychological assistance and community rehabilitation. 151 152 153 Israel s cabinet stood for a moment s silence on October 28 to honor the victims. 154 Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel David Lau said any murder of any Jew in any part of the world for being Jewish is unforgivable. 155 He described the location as a place with a profound Jewish flavor. Many news reports said he refused to refer to the Conservative congregation as a synagogue since it is non-Orthodox. 156 Prominent non-Orthodox Israeli religious leaders and scholars rejected his statement.",
    "157 158 159 Tel Aviv Municipality lit the city hall building with the colors of the American flag in solidarity with the victims of the Pittsburgh attack. 160 161 An image of the Israeli flag next to the American flag was projected onto Jerusalem s Western Wall. 162 Pope Francis denounced the inhuman act of violence in his Sunday prayers in St. Peter s Square on October 28, and led prayers for the dead and wounded, as well as their families. He asked God to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies. 163 Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif offered his thoughts and prayers to the victims of the shooting, and said Extremism and terrorism know no race or religion, and must be condemned in all cases. 164 Hamas offered condolences and condemned the attack, noting that they could relate as being victims of Israeli terror. Hamas had previously expressed support for shootings at synagogues in Israel. 165 166 Jan Kickert, Austrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said The attack... was an attack on all of us, on what we stand for religious liberty, human rights.",
    "We are committed to the safety and security of Jews wherever they are. I say this with growing up and living with the shame that my forefathers were among the worst perpetrators in Nazi times. 167 Media and organizations edit Many local businesses on Murray Avenue put up posters in support of the victims. The New York Times published an op-ed by Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, that urged readers to fight against antisemitism and hate. 168 A CNN editorial described the shooting as one of three hate-incited acts that took place in the United States in the same week, along with a series of mail bombing attempts and a shooting at a Kroger grocery store in Jeffersontown, Kentucky. 169 On October 28, the Empire State Building darkened its lights in honor of the victims. According to the building s Twitter account, the top of the spire was left aglow with an orange halo shining a light on gun violence awareness. 170 In the wake of the shooting, the University of Pittsburgh darkened its traditional Victory Lights atop of the Cathedral of Learning, 171 and on November 2, the university altered the Victory Lights so the blue beam would shine for 11 seconds, one second for each fatality.",
    "172 Sports edit Sports teams that observed a moment of silence for the shooting victims included the Pittsburgh Steelers at their home game against the Cleveland Browns, 173 the New Orleans Saints at the Minnesota Vikings, 174 the Pittsburgh Penguins at the Vancouver Canucks, 175 the Winnipeg Jets at the Toronto Maple Leafs, 176 the Philadelphia Eagles and the Jacksonville Jaguars playing in London, 177 and the Pittsburgh Panthers hosting Duke at Heinz Field. 178 A moment of silence was also observed before Game 4 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium on the night of October 27. 178 The Pittsburgh Penguins wore jerseys with a patch that read Stronger Than Hate for their game against the New York Islanders on October 30. The team announced that, following the game, the team would auction off the jerseys on behalf of the synagogue. 179 Similarly, the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team displayed a Stronger than Hate decal on their helmets during the November 2 game visiting the University of Virginia. 180 NFL player Terrell Suggs wore a Star of David on his cleats during a game in October 2019 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the shooting.",
    "181 Vigils and rallies edit Pittsburgh locals crocheted or knit forms of the Star of David and hung them along Murray Avenue. On the evening of the shooting, over 3,000 people gathered at the intersection of Murray and Forbes avenues in Squirrel Hill for an interfaith candlelight vigil it was organized by students from nearby Taylor Allderdice High School. 182 Two additional vigils were held in the neighborhood. 36 The day after the shooting, an interfaith vigil organized by the regional Jewish Federation was held at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, drawing an overflow crowd estimated at 2,500. 183 Attended by numerous national and local dignitaries, the event featured several speakers, including the rabbis of the three congregations that occupied the synagogue building, Islamic and Christian clergy, and civic leaders. 184 Among those in attendance were Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh Rich Fitzgerald, Allegheny County executive Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey Governor Tom Wolf Naftali Bennett, Israeli Minister for Education and Minister for Diaspora Affairs Ron Dermer, Israeli ambassador to the United States and Danny Danon, permanent representative of Israel to the United Nations.",
    "A video was streamed during the event featuring Israeli president Reuven Rivlin, 185 who offered brief remarks and led the crowd in a recitation of the Kaddish. 186 187 In the week following the attack, Jewish and interfaith communal vigils and solidarity rallies were held across the world. 188 189 In the United States, these were attended by hundreds or thousands of people, 190 in many cities across the nation. d In Canada, they were held in Montreal, Ottawa, Halifax, Vancouver and other places. In Israel, approximately 500 Americans and Israelis lit candles on the night of October 28 at Zion Square in Jerusalem. 189 In Europe, Jewish communal vigils were held in London, Liverpool, Brighton, and Paris. 198 199 College students at more than one hundred campuses across the country held vigils in the days following the shootings in memory of the victims. 200 The American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Federations of North America called for both Jews and non-Jews to attend synagogue services on the Shabbat following the attack, under the hashtag ShowUpForShabbat. NBC News reported thousands of people around the world attended services in local synagogues, community centers, and college campuses, including Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.",
    "201 Additionally, many congregations recited the prayer for martyrs Av HaRachamim even though it would normally be omitted that Shabbat. 202 203 As of 2024, the massacre is still being commemorated. 204 Presidential visit edit US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania disembark Air Force One at Pittsburgh International Airport On October 30, Trump flew to Pittsburgh on Air Force One, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. They went to the synagogue, where they met with Tree of Life spiritual leader Jeffrey Myers and Israeli ambassador to the US Ron Dermer. Trump lit candles for the victims inside and outside placed stones on each of the 11 Star-of-David markers of the memorial. The group went to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, where Trump spoke with wounded victims, their families, law enforcement officials, and medical staff. 143 Trump s visit was discouraged by some in the Pittsburgh community. Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto said Trump should not have come, as the wounds were raw and the community was just beginning to mourn and hold funerals.",
    "205 Peduto, with agreement from Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald, also urged Trump to consider the wills of the families of the deceased. 206 More than 70,000 people had signed an open letter written by Bend the Arc Pittsburgh saying that Trump was not welcome until he fully denounces white nationalism. 207 One of the survivors, Dan Leger, refused to meet Trump in the hospital and later wrote a critical op-ed for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 208 Former Tree of Life president Lynette Lederman opposed Trump s visit, saying she felt his words were hypocritical and that We have people who stand by us who believe in values, not just Jewish values, but believe in values, and those are not the values of this president, and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh. 209 210 211 Before Trump s visit, Tree of Life rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, There is hate, and it isn t going away. It just seems to be getting worse.... We ve got to stop hate, and it can t just be to say we need to stop hate.",
    "We need to do, we need to act to tone down rhetoric, adding that he would welcome a visit from Trump. 209 Aaron Bisno, the rabbi of Rodef Shalom Congregation, said he did not think Trump s presence was beneficial, saying that Trump had become a symbol of division for many. 212 During Trump s visit to the synagogue, an estimated 2,000 protesters were cordoned off a few blocks away. 213 Afterward, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, The President was very warm, very consoling. 214 Neo-Nazis and white supremacists edit Among American neo-Nazis and white supremacists, figures such as Richard B. Spencer, Andrew Anglin, and Matthew Heimbach expressed fear that the backlash over the attack could derail their efforts to gain mainstream political acceptance. 215 4chan users on the pol board viewed the attack as accidentally redpilling people and denied that it had occurred. They claimed the purported attack was a false flag committed by Jews to gain sympathy. Some users on Gab praised the shooting and created the hashtag HeroRobertBowers to express support for the shooter. 215 216 217 On August 10, 2023, Hardy Carroll Lloyd, a man from Follansbee, West Virginia, was arrested for allegedly making threats towards the jurors and witnesses in Bowers s federal trial on social media and in emails and online comments.",
    "According to prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Northern District of West Virginia, Lloyd was a self-proclaimed reverend of a White supremacy movement. He also allegedly expressed support for Bowers and the shooting and had encouraged similar attacks. 218 219 Lloyd was charged with obstruction of the due administration of justice, transmitting threats in interstate and foreign commerce and witness tampering. 220 On September 19, 2023, he pleaded guilty and is expected to face more than six years in prison. 219 Fundraising efforts edit Numerous fundraising efforts were launched in order to assist the survivors of the shooting, pay for the burial of the victims, and pay for the repairs to the synagogue. 221 As of November 1, a GoFundMe campaign which was initiated by an Iranian graduate student in Washington, D.C., had exceeded US 1 million in donations, 222 and a new goal of US 1.2 million has also been surpassed. Muslim groups opened a LaunchGood crowdfunding campaign to help pay for the burial of the victims and survivors medical bills, with the funds to be distributed by the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh.",
    "223 224 As of November 1, that campaign had exceeded its goal of 150,000 with more than 225,000 in contributions. 222 The organizers of the campaign announced that all excess funds would be spent on projects that help foster Muslim-Jewish collaboration, dialogue, and solidarity. 225 The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh raised 3.65 million for victims by November 13 226 donations to that organization were to be matched by the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh Foundation. 221 222 Fundraising campaigns for shooting victims in the Dor Hadash and New Light congregations raised nearly 23,000 combined. 227 A 6.3 million fund was raised for the survivors of the shooting, the families of the 11 dead, and police officers. 228 Documentary edit In 2022, A Tree of Life The Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting documentary was released by HBO Documentary Films. 229 230 See also edit Crime portal Judaism portal Pittsburgh portal Poway synagogue shooting, Occurred six months later and inspired by Bowers Alt-right Violent incidents Antisemitism in the United States in the 21st century Far-right politics United States Geography of antisemitism United States History of the Jews in Pennsylvania List of attacks on Jewish institutions in the United States List of death row inmates in the United States List of synagogue shootings Racism in the United States Jewish Americans Right-wing terrorism Notes edit Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death (11 counts) Hate crimes resulting in death (11 counts) Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury (2 counts) Hate crimes involving an attempt to kill (2 counts) Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon, and resulting in bodily injury to public safety officers (8 counts) Obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury to public safety officers (4 counts) Discharge of a firearm during these crimes of violence (25 counts) 4 Hebrew ע ץ ח י ים או ר ל ש מ ח ה 6 Hebrew דו ר ח ד ש These included Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Buffalo, Charleston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Denver, Houston, Jacksonville, Knoxville, Los Angeles, Madison, Memphis, Middletown, New Haven, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Portland, Rochester, Salt Lake City, Seattle, St. Louis, Washington, Wilkes-Barre and Woodbridge.",
