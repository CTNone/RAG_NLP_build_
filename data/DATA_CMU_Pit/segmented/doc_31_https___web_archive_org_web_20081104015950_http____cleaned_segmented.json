    "PITTSBURGH Greater Pittsburgh International (PIT) PIT-1PITTSBURGH Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) Benchmark Results The current capacity benchmark for Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is 152-160 flights per hour (arrivals and departures) in Optimum weather, when visual approaches can be conducted. The benchmark rate decreases to 143-150 flights per hour in Marginal conditions, and to 119-150 flights per hour in IFR conditions for the most commonly used runway configuration in these conditions. The upper bound of 150 is the facility-called rate, whereas the lower bounds are the modeled benchmarks for these configurations. Note that these benchmarks do not always represent balanced operations there may be more departures than arrivals in the Marginal and IFR scenarios. If the facility reported rates are significantly unbalanced (i.e., unequal numbers of arrivals and departures), the benchmark rates will be unbalanced as well. The facility reported rates reflect current operations at the airport during a busy hour, but such unbalanced rates cannot be sustained for extended periods. Planned technological improvements at PIT would slightly increase the arrival peak capacity in Marginal conditions. The benefit in Marginal conditions assumes that suitably equipped aircraft can use CEFR to maintain visual separations, thus allowing the airport to realize the Optimum rate arrival capacity in Marginal conditions.",
    "The following charts compare actual hourly traffic with the calculated capacity curves for PIT. These values were calculated for the Capacity Benchmarking task and should not be used for other purposes, particularly if more detailed analyses have been performed for the airport or for the individual programs. The list of Planned Improvements and their expected effects on capacity does not imply FAA commitment to or approval of any item on the list.

    "Planned Improvements at PIT include CEFR, for reduced in-trail separations between arrivals in Marginal conditions. Revised wake vortex procedures, to increase arrival throughput on closely spaced parallel runways. However, this improvement does not affect the configurations modeled Additional information on these improvements may be found in the Introduction and Overview of this report, under Assumptions..
