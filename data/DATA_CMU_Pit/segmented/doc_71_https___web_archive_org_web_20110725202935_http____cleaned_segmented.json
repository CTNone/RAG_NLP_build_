Together Toward Tomorrow4 Young Drivers Raise Money for D.A.R.E. Program Young drivers between the ages of seven and 12 years got their first driving experience and a chance to commit to be drug free on July 8 and 9, 2000 as they participated in Kmart s Kids Race Against Drugs (KRAD). Those who came out drove a sleek aerodynamically designed miniature race car, sporting the features of a convertible Ford Mustang.",
    "The vehicles were battery powered and even rode on racing style Goodyear tires. These young drivers, from the Seneca Valley and Mars Area School Districts didn t get to drive the car alone, they were accom- panied by a safety driver. The safety drivers were volunteers and local police officers from Cranberry, Evans City, Jackson, Mars, and Zelienople police departments. We d much rather meet our children in this type of situation than on the streets later, stated Sergeant Dave Lewis, Support Services Commander for the Cranberry Township Police Depart- ment and coordinator of this event. The course was a challenging one for the drivers. They went over bridges, through S-curves, around hairpin turns, and through a tunnel to the finish line. The drivers were timed with professional electronic timing equipment similar to those used in drag racing. The entire KRAD experience was FREE and every child walked away a winner, complete with a KRAD t-shirt and baseball cap. Since many of the drivers brought their families, including younger brothers and sisters, this was truly a community, family event.",
    "Although the younger ones were not able to drive, the safety drivers took them for a quick lap around the course and were rewarded with uncountable smiles. The Kmart Kids Race Against Drugs family event travels to 90 cities making more than 665 stops to show America s children that drugs and alcohol are a dead-end street. The race track is specially designed to be set up in local Kmart parking lots to bring the anti-drug, alcohol, and violence message to more than 700,000 children throughout America. For every child that raced over the two days, the Seneca Valley and Mars D.A.R.E. programs will receive a 5 donation from the Kmart Family Foundation. These funds are used to assist in bringing the D.A.R.E. program to the school districts FREE of charge and without assistance of local tax dollars. In 2000, local officers graduated over 650 students from D.A.R.E. at Seneca Valley, Mars, and St. Gregory s Schools. The final numbers for KRAD in Cranberry for 2000... 654 riders, raising over 3000 for the local D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) Programs.",
    "The organizers estimate that over 150 younger riders were also treated to a free ride on the course. To all those who helped and those who came out, the local school districts and police departments applaud you. Thank you!
