    "The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. 6 In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre- merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. 7 8 9 The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, Dallas Cowboys, and San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933.",
    "The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. 6 To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization s founding. 10 Art Rooney s son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney s son, Art Rooney II. The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation. 11 They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh s North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field.",
    "History Further information History of the Pittsburgh Steelers See also American football in Western Pennsylvania Rooney family era (1933 present) The Steelers first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23 2 to the New York Giants. 6 Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than.500 ( 1936 ). 12 Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions. 6 13 Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. 14 During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the Phil-Pitt Eagles and were known as the Steagles. This team went 5 4 1. 15 In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the Carpets ).",
    "6 This team finished 0 10, marking the only winless team in franchise history. 16 The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8 4 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21 0. 17 That would be Pittsburgh s only playoff game in the pre-merger era they did qualify for a Playoff Bowl in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. 18 In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts ), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. 19 The Steelers also received a 3 million ( 24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.",
    "20 Chuck Noll years (1969 1991) Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s. The Steelers history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season. 21 Noll s most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers Mean Joe Greene in 1969, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970, Jack Ham in 1971, Franco Harris in 1972, 22 and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting four Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster. 23 The Pittsburgh Steelers 1974 draft was their best ever no other team has ever drafted four future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year. 24 The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two.",
    "25 They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins ( 1971 1979 ) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year. The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9 7 record. 26 The 1981 season was no better, with an 8 8 showing. 27 The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. Mean Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982 s playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983 s divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984 s AFC Championship Game appearance. 28 After those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above.500 in 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1987, the year of the players strike, the Steelers finished with a record of 8 7, but missed the playoffs. 29 In 1989, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll s last seasons.",
    "30 Noll s career record with Pittsburgh was 209 156 1. 31 Bill Cowher years (1992 2006) In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton. 32 Steelers five Super Bowl rings before 2009 Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the Blitzburgh defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts. 33 34 Cowher produced the franchise s record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later. 35 With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990.",
    "He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8 8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher s teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher s career record with Pittsburgh was 149 90 1 in the regular season and 161 99 1 overall, including playoff games. 36 Mike Tomlin years (2007 present) Roethlisberger in a Steelers throwback jersey during the team s 500th win in franchise history On January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term retire, leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team. 37 A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy. 38 On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher s successor as head coach. 39 Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history.",
    "40 In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10 6 record and AFC North title. 41 The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31 29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season. 42 The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12 4 mark and a division title. 43 With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship, 44 45 Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27 23 against the Arizona Cardinals. 46 At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl ( Tony Dungy was the first). 47 In their title defense, the Steelers went 9 7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season.",
    "48 In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12 4 record and an AFC North title. 49 The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship. 50 51 Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31 25. 52 In the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12 4 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round. 53 The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins. 54 Overall, the Steelers went 8 8 and missed the postseason in 2012. 55 In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8 8 and missed the postseason. 56 In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11 5 record. 57 They lost 30 17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.",
    "58 The Steelers finished with a 10 6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season. 59 They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. 60 61 In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11 5 record. 62 They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. 63 64 65 In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13 3 mark. 66 Their postseason was short lived with a 45 42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. 67 Despite a 9 6 1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs. 68 The Steelers went 8 8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season. 69 The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11 0 start. 70 However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12 4. 71 The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48 37.",
    "72 The 2021 season saw the team go 9 7 1 and make the postseason. 73 The Steelers lost 42 21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. 74 Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season. 75 Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin s record is 162 94 2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013 17 seasons were noted for record performances from the Killer B s. This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le Veon Bell. 76 Occasionally, the Killer B s has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals. 77 Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. 78 Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9 8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season. 79 In the 2023 season, the team finished 10 7 and third in the AFC North. 80 They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31 17.",
    "81 Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. 82 The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos. 83 84 Summary Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444 282 2 (.635) and an overall record of 480 305 2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. 85 Ownership Art Rooney II, controlling owner of the Steelers Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations. 86 Dan Rooney, and his son, Art Rooney II, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers Timothy and Patrick wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York.",
    "87 Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines, causing them to violate NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests. 88 Upon Dan Rooney s death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30, the following made up the other investors at the time Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr., John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys.

This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club s inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the Steagles the team s colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms.",
    "Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams the Penguins have previously used Vegas Gold, a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers gold is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city s official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the Steelmark, originally designed by Pittsburgh s U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland -based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word Steelers surrounded by three astroids ( hypocycloids of four cusps ). The original meanings behind the astroids were, Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world. Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.",
    "100 While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word Steel, the team was given permission to add ers in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. 101 A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ( Futura Condensed ) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.",
    "The 2007 2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963 1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the bumblebee jerseys due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee.",
    "The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season. 102 Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed. 103 In 1979, the team owners were approached by then- Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team s uniforms in the image of the Steelers. 104 Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors. Rivals The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division ( Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals ).",
    "They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years. 105 106 107 Divisional rivals Cleveland Browns Main article Browns Steelers rivalry The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9 31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66 27 1 (including 42 6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75 58 1 108 The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970 85) and 15 (2004 present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh.",
    "This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021. 109 110 Baltimore Ravens Main article Ravens Steelers rivalry Pittsburgh s rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable matchups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore s M T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20 13, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13 10. Later that season ( 2001 ) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27 10 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16 0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9 6, in Baltimore (the Ravens final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game.",
    "The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32 24. 111 The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3 1 record. 112 Cincinnati Bengals Main article Bengals Steelers rivalry The Steelers rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFL NFL merger was completed. In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7 3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31 17 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer s knee during a passing play. 113 The Bengals players called this a dirty play the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry.",
    "The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38 31, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11 5 and 8 8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18 16 Steelers comeback victory. 60 The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63 35. 114 The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.",
    "115 Conference New England Patriots Main article Patriots Steelers rivalry The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28 3 while the Steelers won 7 6 in 1997 both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin s final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30 14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15 1 regular season. The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period ( 1998 2007 ) before the Steelers broke through with a 33 10 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times.",
    "The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55 31.

They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers tight end Jesse James was controversially called back. 116 Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17 10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh. In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135 75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4 1 record.

Tennessee Titans Main article Steelers Titans rivalry Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34 31 playoff showdown in 2002 ) the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997 2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27 24 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020. 118 Denver Broncos Main article Broncos Steelers rivalry The Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland s six).",
    "The Steelers rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23 13. The following year, they met in the NFL s first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35 35 tie. Denver s first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round the Broncos won 34 21.

Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium the Steelers pulled the upset 24 17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24 23. In 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, where Denver squeaked out at 24 21 win. 119 Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34 17 in Colorado.

In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27 19. Oakland Raiders Main article Raiders Steelers rivalry The Steelers rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13 7 victory over the Raiders the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.",
    "121 The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33 14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24 13) and 1975 (16 10) to reach the Super Bowl. The Raiders responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24 7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Raider George Atkinson as part of the NFL s criminal element after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38 10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury. While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to the Raiders decline after 2002 ), the teams have had notable games against each other, including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20 13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth.",
    "In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski s third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27 24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35 3, and ended their 3-game winning streak the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31 21 gap to win 34 31. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21 18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38 35 at Heinz Field.

The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers).
