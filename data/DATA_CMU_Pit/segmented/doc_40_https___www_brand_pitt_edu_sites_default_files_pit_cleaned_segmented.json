MASCOT HISTORY The adoption of the panther mascot dates back to 1909, during a meeting of student and alumni leaders. According to alumnus George M.P. Baird, who first suggested the idea, Felis Concolor was chosen as the University s mascot for the following reasons (1) it was the most formidable creature once indigenous to the Pittsburgh region (2) it had ancient, heraldic standing as a noble animal (3) the happy accident of alliteration (4) the close approximation of its hue to the gold of Pitt s colors, blue and old gold and (5) no other college or university then employed it as a symbol.

The cap height is the distance from the top of the capital letter to its bottom. Larger minimum sizes may be necessary for other media such as video and film, or products that require specialized manufacturing. There may be situations where Pittsburgh Athletics marks will need to appear smaller than the minimum shown (e.g., lapel pins, pens, pencils and CD spine labels). Contact University of Pittsburgh Licensing Trademarks for guidance. There may be cases where it is difficult to allow the full-recommended clear space (e.g., a very small display ad), and your best judgment should prevail.",
    "It is very important that designers or desktop publishers do not attempt to construct the logo themselves. Do not reproduce the logo by scanning a previously printed version. Such second-generation art will degrade the quality of the image and may alter the scale of the various elements. PITT ATHLETICS BRAND IDENTITY 57BRAND IDENTITY CATHEDRAL STRIPE Unique prints or patterns can create separation and elevate the Pitt Athletics brand, a custom linear pattern has been designed to represent Pitt and enrich the overall identity package. The Cathedral Stripe is a distinguishing brand element that evokes consistency, adds another layer of story telling and ultimately a sense of pride in the institution. The repeat of the pointed arches is the most literal nod to the Cathedral of Learning. The repetition of the shape is not only a literal nod to the aesthetic of the building, but also tells the story of strength in numbers. Arches support the pressure of the building. The more there are, the more that pressure is dispersed. This same ideal applies to a team mentality in the athletic realm. Limited Restricted Use. Prior Approval Required.",

The Pitt Athletics Brand Identity System is designed to support a range of creative expression, from the calm to the dynamic. You can now infuse any expression with precisely the right tone to support the right marketing message for your audience.
