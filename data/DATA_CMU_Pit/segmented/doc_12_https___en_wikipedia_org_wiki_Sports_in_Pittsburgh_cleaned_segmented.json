    "Sports in Pittsburgh - Wikipedia See also American football in Western Pennsylvania Main article Pittsburgh As the home of the MLB s Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, PNC Park is located in North Shore, in front of the Allegheny River, Roberto Clemente Bridge, and the Pittsburgh city skyline. Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil War. Baseball, hockey, and the first professional American football game had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the City of Champions when the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Panthers football team, and Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s. 1 Today, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and Penguins while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a Division I Power Five conference, the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men s and women s basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men s and women s ice hockey teams.",
    "Pittsburgh s major teams have seen great success, with the MLB s Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL s Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL s Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball. The flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William Pitt s coat of arms Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city s first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, and that team s non-NHL predecessor, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh s second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley s upbringing in Ontario.",
    "In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins, 2 3 who have used the black and gold combination since the 1935 36 NHL season. 4 5 In 1975, late Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which has become arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team. 6 Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian and retired professional wrestler Kurt Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman. Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the Cradle of Quarterbacks 7 8 due to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana. The hometown Pittsburgh Penguins NHL ice hockey team defeats the Washington Capitals in Game 7 of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs second round en route to winning the Stanley Cup championship two rounds later. As of 2024, this is the most recent major league sports championship won by a Pittsburgh team.",
    "Professional team sports edit The City of Pittsburgh has had various professional sports franchises throughout its history and today is home to three teams competing at the highest professional level in their respective sports the Pittsburgh Pirates of the MLB, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL, and the Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL.

    "10 On April 15, 1876, Recreation Park was the site of a game between the Xanthas and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (alternately spelled Alleghenys 11 ), an unrelated forerunner to the Alleghenys team which would later be renamed the Pirates. The Alleghenies won the game 7 3. 12 The 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the International Association only a Canadian team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season. 1882 marked the first major league and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute. 13 The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss, who would go down in history as the Father of the modern World Series and its precursor, the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series. He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel (first modern ) baseball stadium, Forbes Field.",
    "Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901 1903, 1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925. The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport. 14 The franchise won the World Series three more times in 1960, 1971, and 1979. In 1960, the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run, hit by Bill Mazeroski, and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title. Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards Seasonal ( Willie Stargell, co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game ( Dave Parker ), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season.",
    "15 Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992. Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 ( Dick Groat ), 1966 ( Roberto Clemente ), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 ( Barry Bonds ), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 ( Andrew McCutchen ) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 ( Vernon Law ) and 1990 ( Doug Drabek ). In 2001, the team opened PNC Park on the city s North Shore, regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, the Pittsburgh Stogies, Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915. 16 The Pittsburgh Keystones, Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh Crawfords played in the Negro leagues. With players including Josh Gibson and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles the most by any Negro league team 1 including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945.",
    "The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a.633 winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and Satchel Paige and claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some who? as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first modern ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee constructed the first steel and concrete modern stadium in the Negro leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 1932. 17 Basketball edit Pittsburgh South Side won Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and Central Basketball League titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The Black Fives league enjoyed success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920 23. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937 39 and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944 45 continued professional basketball in the city in the National Basketball League. Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the NBA, the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played a single season 1947 48 before folding.",
    "The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL, posting the city s best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers, which were owned by Harry Connick Sr. citation needed After the ABA Pipers Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994 95 season. Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh s second pro-basketball world title. 1 In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh Xplosion, a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie Lewis, 18 played in a revamped ABA CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008 09 season because of the economic recession.",
    "Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh Phantoms of the American Basketball Association, played during the 2009 10 season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead, but folded prior to the following season. Pittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season neutral site NBA games, including Wilt Chamberlain s record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand. 19 Hockey edit See also Flyers Penguins rivalry and Sports in Philadelphia Pittsburgh First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall. The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights.",
    "In 1905 1907, the city was represented in the International Professional Hockey League, the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh Professionals. Pittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city s first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League. 20 In 1961, Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 NHL expansion, the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena. 21 The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009. 22 The teams included players Mark Recchi, Kevin Stevens, Jaromír Jágr, and Mario Lemieux.",
    "23 Lemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. 24 25 He suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin s lymphoma, throughout his career. 26 In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from bankruptcy. He returned to play one year later as the first player owner of the modern era. 27 The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby, returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise s third Cup in 2009. 28 The franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017. Football edit On November 12, 1892, Pudge Heffelfinger was paid 500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic Association. With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. citation needed The first professional football game was held at Recreation Park in Pittsburgh. citation needed Heffelfinger scored the game s only points as the Allegheny Athletic Association defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, 4 0. 29 30 The early professional football era was also represented in Pittsburgh, by top athletic association teams in the Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit.",
    "The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, was the top pro team in the state in 1898 and 1899. The first ever pro football all-star game was played at Exposition Park between the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and a collection of players from several teams in the area on December 3, 1898. Duquesne won the game 16 0. Later the Homestead Library Athletic Club, fielded the top pro team in the state in 1900 and 1901. In 1902 the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple, the owners of baseball s Pittsburgh Pirates. The team featured baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson, a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius, and outfielder with Pirates. The team won the league s only championship in 1902. In 1933, as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney, who had been raised on the North Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
    "31 Originally nicknamed the Pirates, 32 the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city s heritage of producing steel. The Steelers first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947. 33 In 1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted players in order to improve the team. 34 Three years later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh s rookie running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate Reception. In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher, who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008. 33 As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.",
    "35 In October 1964, Ernie Stautner, who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers player to have his number 70 retired. 36 Charles Mean Joe Greene had his number 75 retired in 2014. In 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers fans as the best in the NFL, citing their unbelievable sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. 37 38 Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, son of founder Art Rooney, became the majority owner of the Steelers in November 2008 along with his son Art II, after they bought all of the shares of two of his four brothers. 39 Outside of the NFL, the city was represented by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937. It was also briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League, in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (which later became the Tampa Bay Storm ), of the Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990. A second Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power, played in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014.",
