All rights reserved.41 fig. 2.1 The Golden Triangle O f the various claims about who first likened downtown Pittsburgh to a Golden Triangle, one has primacy. After the Great Fire of 1845 ravaged the city s core, Mayor William Howard is said to have declared, We shall make of this triangle of blackened ruins a golden triangle whose fame will endure as a priceless heritage. The Golden Triangle nickname was already well established locally by 1914, when an article in the Saturday Evening Post gave it national publicity. The nickname was a good fit because the 255 acres bounded by Grant Street and the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers must count among the most gilded in the United States, having generated immense wealth. The Triangle constitutes a city in itself, with retail strips on Wood and Smithfield streets and Forbes and Fifth avenues, a government center on Grant, two churches and the Duquesne Club on Sixth Avenue, and extensive cultural facilities set among the cast-iron fronts and loft buildings on Penn and Liberty avenues. The compactness of the Golden Triangle is a marvel in its own right no two of its points are more than a fifteen-minute walk apart.",

In winter, they tend to stay indoors by using the subway and the tunnels, atri- ums, and interior streets of the new buildings. During the other seasons they move outdoors and enjoy Point State Park or Market Square, which has 42 been hosting public gatherings since 1784. At noon every day, lunch crowds descend on Mellon Square, PPG Place, PNC Plaza, or the plazas set around PITTSBURGH A NEW the U.S. Steel tower and 625 Liberty. PPG Place was designed as a contem- PORTRAIT porary variant of Paris s Place Vend√¥me, but its main attraction now is a fountain that doubles in winter as an ice-skating rink. The remaking of the Triangle during the Pittsburgh Renaissance of the 1950s was a closely guarded process, led by Richard King Mellon and Mayor David L. Lawrence with a largely self-taught staff under Park Martin, Wallace Richards, and John Robin.",
    "The upgrading of the Triangle in the 1980s (the so-called Renaissance II) was, by contrast, a technocratic rather than an autocratic process, with Mayor Richard Caliguiri and the Urban Redevelop ment Authority devising the urban upgrades. The results were nevertheless substantial the subway, cosmetic improvements to Grant Street, the first Lawrence Convention Center (even though it was a functional and artistic dis appointment), Liberty Center, Oxford Centre, Mellon Center, PPG Place, Chatham Center II, Fifth Avenue Place, and 625 Liberty in the Triangle, with spin-off developments in the Strip, the South Side, and the North Side. These renewal efforts involved about five times as much build- ing as in the original Renaissance projects in the 1950s. fig. 2.2 The Fountain at the Point 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

    "Across the whole of Downtown and in the adjacent Strip, dozens of older buildings have been converted to student dormitories, apartments, or condominiums. Parking remains a hurdle to Downtown redevelopment, not so much in its scarcity as its cost. (However, you can park all day in downtown Pittsburgh for the price of a half hour in midtown Manhattan.) Retail is spotty the sub- urban malls get most of the trade, and the only large department store still in Downtown is the Macy s that was Kaufmann s for 135 years. Only one movie theater remains from the dozen of a century ago. Overall, though, entertain- ment and the arts are flourishing Downtown. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust now manages five updated theaters and concert halls in the Triangle Heinz Hall, Benedum Center, the Byham and O Reilly theaters, and the Harris Theater, an art cinema. Finally diversified from its old state as a purely busi- ness center, the Triangle s current health is vigorous where it leads, the rest of Pittsburgh will follow. 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.",

Not everyone would agree with Parton that modern history first announced itself in Pittsburgh. Events of some importance also took place in Williams burg, Boston, and Philadelphia, not to mention Athens, Florence, and Runnymede. But the juncture of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers known as the Forks of the Ohio in the eighteenth century was the setting for three milestones. At that spot in 1758, North America was secured for the British and not the French. In 1875, Andrew Carnegie s revolutionary steel mill secured the industrial might of the world for the United States and not Europe. In 1945, there began one of the most striking rebirths of any city in the country. The fifty-nine acres at the Forks of the Ohio are today split between Point State Park and Gateway Center, together encompassing twelve office and residential towers, four bridges over land and water, two military strong- holds, and one of the world s more vivid fountains.",
    "The views across the water to the South Side and North Side capture the industrial history of Pittsburgh, while on the land side stands Gateway Center, the starting point for the city s rebirth in the 1950s. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that without Gateway Center, the city might have withered to an unrecognizable husk of its former glory. The British intended Fort Pitt to be their stronghold in North America, and its construction became the first great accomplishment in Pittsburgh. When a military engineer, Captain Harry Gordon, devised it in 1759, he had the benefit of three centuries of advancement in the science of fortifications, going all the way back to Renaissance Italy. Gordon gave the fort the shape of a slightly irregular pentagon with five pointed bastions. The bastions mini- mized cannon fire from direct broadside hits on the long sides and helped pin down enemy troops before they could storm the walls. Two of the bastions had walls nearly fifteen feet high and seven and a half feet thick. Those solid stone walls were faced with 1,244,160 bricks.",
    "The fortress walls were keyed to the kinds of attacks the British anticipated on the land side, from which infantry would attack, the walls were of brick and stone facing the water, across which cannon would fire, there were earthworks to absorb the blows. Inside the fort was a parade ground with casemates (underground rooms framed in timber), magazines, and housing for a thousand men outside was 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved.a moat with a drawbridge and an earthen embankment. The bricks were made locally, the stone was quarried locally, and the timber was planed at a stream in Pittsburgh s West End that has ever since been known as Saw Mill Run. Luckily, the greatest fort England ever built in the Western Hemisphere 46 was put to the test only once, in Pontiac s Rebellion of 1763. Despite its elegance, the fort had major problems. The river-oriented earthworks eroded PITTSBURGH A NEW badly in the spring floods, and none of the bastions proved effective against PORTRAIT snipers. In 1764, dismayed by the fort s poor performance, Colonel Henry Bouquet constructed five redoubts outside its walls to catch snipers in cross- fire one of them survives.",
    "Fort Pitt and the other four redoubts were allowed to tumble into ruins just one generation after the French threat ended. When the Grenadier, Music, and Flag bastions were rebuilt in the 1950s, their plans and details were based on archaeological observations. Nonetheless, experts later found fault with the restoration the Music Bastion was not accurate, the bricks in the walls being mostly modern, and the moat opposite the Hilton Hotel was narrower and shallower than the original. These charges were used as justification for filling in the moat in 2008 in order to expand the area for fig. 2.5 concerts and other public events. Fort Pitt Block House, the The Block House, as Colonel Bouquet s surviving pentagonal redoubt is oldest structure misnamed, still carries his name and the date 1764 inscribed over the door. It in Pittsburgh retains its original sandstone base, a complete rim of wooden girders, and coursed common-bond brick walls. Iron cranking plates in the walls support the upper floor, and the diminutive building bears a modern pyramidal roof of wooden shingles. This glimpse into American colonial history is the oldest surviving structure in Pittsburgh.",
    "By the first decades of the nineteenth century, Fort Pitt had been so thoroughly vandalized that even the earthen ramparts were gone. A few voices suggested that the Point could be turned into the city s first park, but the fate of the site was sealed in 1854, when the Pennsylvania Railroad built the Duquesne Freight Depot directly over the ruins. It would take nearly a century for the city and state to redevelop the Point for shared use as a his- toric park and an office complex. In 1947, while the development of Gateway Center was being debated, Edgar J. Kaufmann gave Frank Lloyd Wright a new commission (they had partnered to create Fallingwater a decade earlier). Kaufmann wanted renderings for a circular megastructure thirteen levels high and one-fifth of a mile in diameter, with a helical auto ramp that would have been four and a half miles long.

    "This episode supports the idea that history repeats itself, since John Augustus Roebling had proposed a double suspen- sion bridge for the Point a century earlier. 47 George Richardson, who engineered the Fort Pitt Bridge over the Monongahela and the Fort Duquesne Bridge over the Allegheny, was a mas- ter of bridge design during his forty-year career in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. Richardson and his design team transformed what might have been a potentially ugly overpass connecting the two bridges into a luminous portal of three ultrathin stretched barrel vaults. The tensioning of the prestressed reinforcing rods in the concrete vaults was so complex that the final calcula- tions of 1962 were personally overseen by the celebrated French bridge builder Eug√®ne Freyssinet just before his death that same year. The eye-catching element in Point State Park turned out to be not its fort but its fountain. All of the planners who had eyed the Point for a hundred years imagined some focal element here. For Wright, it was a fountain for Robert Moses, a shining beacon for other visionaries it was a colossal sculp- ture of a steelworker, an allegorical Meeting of the Waters, or the legendary steelworker Joe Magarac.",
    "(Legend holds that Magarac which is Slovak for jack-ass was the strongest steelworker in Pittsburgh. According to the tale, he would measure the consistency of a ladle of molten steel by tasting it and ended his life by leaping into a blast furnace to upgrade the quality of its iron ore.) What emerged in 1974 was a geyser that normally jets about 150 feet high but can rise to challenge all aquatic records to more than 300 feet. It spews 6,000 gallons of water a minute from a 100,000-gallon hidden reservoir fed by an aquifer some 50 feet below ground. (This so-called fourth river is a staple of Pittsburgh trivia quizzes.) The fountain was not the only way to accentuate the Point, but since the old Pittsburgh had its columns of fire and smoke, there is some appropriateness to this play of waters as a symbol for the cleaner city of today. Until the 1990s, Pittsburgh was the only city with structures designed by both of the grand Kahns of American architecture Albert and Louis. In the 1930s, the industrial architect Albert Kahn put up an important component of the Heinz factories on the North Side, and in 1976, Louis Kahn (no rela- tion) designed the American Wind Symphony s barge Point-Counterpoint II, which for several decades was docked on the Allegheny River frontage of the Point.",

Conceived in 1947, One, Two, and Three Gateway were among the most talked-about buildings after World War II because, apart from New York s Rockefeller Center, so large a single-blueprint commercial complex could be found nowhere else in the world.",
    "Also making the leap of faith were the corporations that signed up as tenants Jones Laughlin Steel, PPG Industries, People s Gas, and Westinghouse, which made their commitments on the basis of nothing more than a sketch. The design of these cruciform towers represented a tug of war between the traditionalists Otto Eggers and Daniel Higgins, both involved with John Russell Pope in the design of the National Gallery and the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, and the progressive Irwin Clavan, who in the same years designed cruciform-tower housing estates in New York. Behind Gateway Center also lies the exemplar of Le Corbusier s towers-in-the-park scheme for Paris in 1922. Between seven and fifteen cruciform towers were originally projected for Pittsburgh, all in traditional brick and limestone. At the last minute the designs were respecified for stainless steel, but scarcities because of the Korean War resulted in the use of chrome-alloyed steel. When building resumed in Equitable Plaza, across Liberty Avenue, from 1955 to 1968, the landscape architects used a more informal site plan. However, the continuous perimeter podium they created makes this half of Gateway Center more difficult to enter from the adjoining streets.",
    "The Verizon Building and the Pennsylvania State Office Building on the plaza are conven- tional office slabs, but the bold shape of Four Gateway, with its long glass tower and extruded stainless-steel service wing, is a fine expression of mid- century modernism. One of the criticisms of Gateway Center (especially in Jane Jacobs s The Death and Life of Great American Cities) is the way it turned its back on the larger city. Fifth Avenue Place, on the opposite side of Stanwix Street, was the first building in thirty-five years to create a visual link with the Gateway complex rather than standing back from it, as the PPG and Riverfront Center, at 20 Stanwix Street, complexes do. 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Afterward, these fittings were added so that enor- mous brass plates can be placed over the windows to keep the Allegheny out, should it rise that high again. Three important buildings complete Equitable Plaza toward the Monongahela bank. The United Steelworkers Building is the main monu- ment to organized labor in Pittsburgh, the city in which the Iron Steel Workers Union (predecessor of the American Federation of Labor) was organized in 1876. The union headquarters building, originally constructed for IBM, is also a milestone in skyscraper architecture it shattered a long-held dogma of skyscraper construction whereby the exterior walls generally did not support any of the load. For this skyscraper, however, U.S. Steel instead fabricated an exterior load-bearing wall in place of a conventional curtain wall.",
    "During construction, the three different types of steel in the exterior walls were painted red, white, or blue to designate their different structural roles. The midcentury slickness of the design can at times be cloying, but particularly at night the thirteen-story diamond-faceted walls of stainless steel hover alluringly over the heavy concrete base. The union building faces a mildly Gothic brick-faced St. Mary of Mercy Church on the opposite corner of Boulevard of the Allies and Stanwix. A harmless legend possibly even true holds that the church stands just where the first Mass in Pittsburgh was celebrated in 1754. Behind the United Steelworkers tower, overlooking the Monongahela s bank at Stanwix Street at the corner of Fort Pitt Boulevard, stands the former world headquarters of Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The dark gray anodized aluminum slab for what was then one of Pittsburgh s corporate mainstays was less progres- sive in design than the same company s research centers built in the 1950s and 1960s at Churchill and Monroeville. Nonetheless, Westinghouse was technically distinguished by its pioneering integration of the lighting, heating, and air-conditioning systems and by having the world s first talking elevators, developed by Westinghouse, of course.",

PITTSBURGH A NEW First Side is a finely scaled district comprising the dozen blocks along the PORTRAIT Monongahela waterfront from Stanwix to Grant streets and from Fort Pitt Boulevard to the Boulevard of the Allies. Its western end, between Stanwix and Market streets, follows John Campbell s provisional plan of 1764. The layout of First Side was shaped a second time by the Great Fire of 1845, which leveled most of it, and a third time by the enlargement of Second Avenue into the Boulevard of the Allies, in 1922. The resulting traffic flow cut First Side off from the rest of Downtown, which helped preserve it. Its richly detailed shops and warehouses, with dramatic views of the Monongahela River and Mount Washington, are now being enhanced by 151 FirstSide, an eighteen-story tower on the waterfront that was the first new condominium in the Golden Triangle since the Pittsburgh Renaissance.",
    "Architecturally, the most consistent block remaining from the old Golden Triangle is the 100 block of Market Street between the Boulevard of the Allies and First Avenue. Here, except for two gaps, both sides of the street are packed with commercial structures that have residential lofts on the top floors. The buildings are largely mid- and late nineteenth-century substitutes for shops and warehouses that were lost in the fire of 1845. Whatever fate held in store for Pittsburgh in 1784, surveyor George Woods was sure it would be linked to the Monongahela, so he drew most of his 490 lots as narrow strips on the numbered avenues parallel to the Monon- gahela. In consequence, scores of First Side s towers have double fa√ßades that stretch from one avenue to another. This feature is particularly evident in the 200 block of Fort Pitt Boulevard, between Market and Wood streets, where a dozen of the best old commercial buildings front on both the Monongahela and First Avenue. For a hundred years, until 1955, the riverbank was a single broad levee, where steamboats would pick up and disgorge passengers and freight.",
    "The steamboat and barge trade was so voluminous at Pittsburgh that for a century the city claimed to be the world s busiest inland port in some quarters that claim persists.

Two examples of the latter are 235 and 239 Fort Pitt, where iron elements were bolted over traditional brick and wood fa√ßades. Closer to the Point, at number 231, is an elegantly restored Italianate brick and stone fa√ßade. The old four-story warehouse at 227 Fort Pitt Boulevard now stands as a contemporary evocation of the oriel fronts or narrow bay windows that once overlooked many of Pittsburgh s streets a century ago.",
    "Wood Street unfolds its architectural character block by block from the Monongahela to Liberty Avenue, offering excellent examples of architectural styles popular after the Great Fire of 1845. One block in from the river, at the corner of Wood Street and First Avenue, stand four Beaux-Arts skyscrapers (two with matching fa√ßades on the Boulevard of the Allies), which in their gravitas suggest Pittsburgh s consciousness of being midway between Chicago and New York, with the power of the first tempered by the urbanity of the second. At 101 103 Wood Street there survives another of Pittsburgh s cast- iron fronts, this one from about 1860. Despite a lifeless retrofitting in the 1980s, the iron-stamped Gothic fa√ßade provided some inspiration for the design of the neighboring Wood-Allies Garage on the Boulevard of the Allies. That nine-level steel-deck cage begins with a red neo-Romanesque brick base and ends as a parody of the fake Gothic pinnacles of PPG down the block. After two blocks that are predominantly Beaux-Arts in character, Wood Street switches its architectural code at the intersection with Boule vard of the Allies to Art Deco in the twenty-one-story main building of Point Park University (the university uses Wood Street as the central promenade of its urban campus).",
    "What failed once as an athletic club and again as a hotel today succeeds as a leading center for the performing arts.

PPG PITTSBURGH Place occupies five and a half acres in a complex of eight elements that occupy A NEW PORTRAIT or touch six city blocks.",
    "The central element is the half-acre open plaza, with a forty-story glass tower in the center and five uniformly detailed low-rise structures around it. Between the tower and the Gateway Center complex on Stanwix Street lies the three-story Wintergarden atrium, while a second atrium below Two PPG Place is home to restaurants and specialty shops. Everything is sheathed in uniform mirror glass, with twenty thousand pieces of silver PPG Solarban in the tower alone. In winter, the outdoor plaza becomes a skating rink the rest of the year children enjoy the user-friendly water feature fountains around the central obelisk. The creation of PPG Place in 1984 was an American corporation s out- standing act of generosity toward its home city. Pittsburgh Plate Glass was founded half a block away in 1883 by John Pitcairn and John B. Ford. Today, it is the largest producer of glass in the world, as well as a giant in paints, plas- tics, and chemicals. When the company considered building a headquarters tower near its birthplace on Market Street, it knew that it would be relatively easy to buy only the half acre it needed.",
    "But what PPG really wanted was to upgrade the whole district in the manner of Rockefeller Center, so it pur- chased an area ten times larger than needed for its own building. It was a daring move, considering the financial and political risks involved. Another daring move was the selection of Philip Johnson s unconventional Post- modern Gothic design for the PPG office tower. It marked only the second time in the postwar era (after Johnson s design for the AT T headquarters in New York) that an American corporation had chosen fantasy over the staid International School Style for its public image. The obvious precedent of the PPG design is the Victoria Tower at the Houses of Parliament in London, though it is only about half the height of PPG s 635 feet. There was also a local model the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh. PPG s tower is a brilliant apparition when seen from outside the Triangle, for example, from West Park on the North Side. Unlike the Cathedral of Learning, which has a rich variety of surface and texture, the PPG tower tends to the monotonous at close range.",

The two-block stretch of Fourth Avenue from PPG Place PORTRAIT up to Smithfield Street, intersected by Wood Street, was once home to the dozen banks that stored this capital. Pittsburgh still has high importance as a financial center, but the oil and stock exchanges and most of the banks that made Fourth Avenue an erstwhile rival to Wall Street were torn down years ago.",
    "The most distinguished of these vanished structures was Frank Furness s quirky but lovable Farmers Deposit National Bank as well as the Bank of Pittsburgh, the latter a close approximation of the New York Stock Exchange. Constructed in 1896, the Bank of Pittsburgh came down in the 1940s, although its columns survive in Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in suburban Pleasant Hills. As the oldest commercial building and the only externally intact Greek Revival structure in Downtown today, the Burke Building at 209 Fourth Avenue has seen it all. Built in 1836, and for a time serving as a bank, it stood for a decade before the Great Fire skirted it by a few feet in 1845. The build- ing s owners were the Irish-born lawyers Robert and Andrew Burke their architect, John Chislett, was born in England in 1800 and schooled himself in the Neoclassical traditions seen in the buildings of Bath. Chislett came to Pittsburgh around 1833 and was the city s dominant architect during the mid-nineteenth century. The Burke Building today resembles a domestic more than a commercial design a brick structure faced in sandstone, Doric col- umns at the door, and a four-square plan with fireplaces and a central stair hall.",

The trio of the Benedum-Trees, Investment, and Arrott buildings on Fourth Avenue just below Wood might recall the fortified towers of medieval Bologna or San Gimignano. The rhythm for the group was set by the Arrott, at the corner of Fourth and Wood. Its designer, Frederick Osterling (1865 1934), was both prolific and quarrelsome, but he was a generally brilliant designer in Pittsburgh for nearly half a century. His range of styles included Romanesque, Classical Revival, and modern Gothic. Osterling s design for an insurance magnate demonstrates the usual academic sequence of a large-scale base intended for retail purposes, then a shaft of office floors in rusticated brick patterning, and a cap of four stories with tall arched 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

Three years after Osterling designed the Arrott, the Machesney tower rose at 221 Fourth Avenue it was later renamed the Benedum-Trees Building 59 after the oilmen Michael Benedum and Joseph Trees bought it.",
    "At nineteen stories, Benedum-Trees was only slightly lower than the Arrott, and it clearly responded both to the Arrott and to the now-vanished Bank of Pittsburgh in its dramatic base of Corinthian columns and oriel windows, an aggressively vertical terra-cotta shaft, and an enormous overhanging entablature complete with lions and florid curved brackets. The Investment Building at 239 Fourth Avenue went up in the 1920s, making it a generation younger than the towers left and right of it. Its brick shaft is a total abstraction without ornament, but at the top the corners are sliced away to reveal a set of elegant obelisks, powerful enough to catch the eye of Philip Johnson when he designed his Neo classical obelisk for PPG Place down the block. Point Park University Center is an adaptive reuse of a group of six banks that once clustered together in the 400 block of Wood and up Fourth and Forbes avenues. The first two banks were the Freehold Building and the Real Estate Trust Company on Fourth Avenue, both from the 1890s. These were joined at the corner of Fourth and Wood in 1901 by the People s Savings Bank, a fifteen-story tower that mirrors the Arrott tower across Wood Street.",
    "It might be called competent rather than remarkable except for the brilliantly handled semi-circular stairwell inside and the raised brick panels that are randomly scattered on the exterior, giving the building the appearance of a decaying Roman ruin. The bank s most delicious feature is its two dramatic reliefs of industrious bees, easily inspected from the sidewalk. In 1902, the Colonial Trust Company cut sideways through the block to create a fourth building, with twin Renaissance-style fa√ßades on Fourth and Forbes avenues what was supposedly the world s longest bank lobby ran in between. In 1926, the dual fa√ßades became a trio when the lobby was extended as a T-shape and fronted with a severe Ionic pediment at 414 Wood. The sixth and last piece of the puzzle fell into place the next year, when a new building linked the Wood Street fa√ßades of the People s Bank tower to the Colonial Trust. In 1976, prominent Argentina-born designer Rodolfo Machado, who was working for the IKM Partnership and taught at Carnegie Mellon, came up with a cool, minimalist design for a shopping mall project that would amal- gamate these buildings.",

The three towers were eventually amalgamated into the Union National Bank, whose core structure was converted into the Carlyle, a luxury condominium residence, in 2007. The first fourteen floors of standard units and four top floors of double-sized apartments sold at such a satisfying rate that the developers purchased the Commonwealth Building for conversion into an additional sixty residences. The upper end of the same Fourth Avenue block is considerably less sober. The evolving social and business attitudes in mid- and late nineteenth- century America can be discerned by comparing the efflorescence of the earlier Dollar Bank, at the upper corner intersecting Smithfield Street, to the straitlaced Union National, at the lower corner intersecting Wood. Dollar Bank, dating from 1871, with wings added in 1906, is the ultimate in public relations architecture it is a building that is all doorway.",

The ornament is vigorous, learned, and delightful, but the essential lines of the fa√ßade are drowned by the Baroque and Italianate details. The imbalance of the part and the whole, so characteristic of American architecture after the Civil War, was the problem that would occupy H. H. Richardson, who was just beginning his architectural career when Dollar Bank went up.

The flagship of this upper block is the Standard Life Building at 345 Fourth Avenue, dressed in deep red Roman bricks and terra- cotta plaques. The Standard Life skyscraper talks to People s Savings at the lower end of the block with its exaggerated detail on the upper floors, particu- larly the colossal arch stones set over the top windows. To the left of Standard Life is the earliest building of this cluster, the Fidelity Trust Building from 1889, at 341 Fourth. It begins well with a base of two massive arched doors and a dwarf mezzanine of three rectangular openings with colonettes, but in the upper floors the fa√ßade changes rhythm at almost every level, as though slices of a half dozen different buildings had been stacked atop one another. In 1898, a decade after the construction of the Fidelity Trust Building, Henry Clay Frick summoned the dean of American architects, Daniel Burnham, to build the small Union Trust Company (now the Engineers Society) at 337 Fourth, immediately next door.",
    "This little Greek temple, with a podium of deeply channeled blocks below and severe Doric columns above, was the first of eleven projects that Burnham drew up for Pittsburgh more than he created for any city except his native Chicago. Next door to Burnham s monu- ment, local architect Charles M. Bartberger built a considerably more accom- plished structure for his Industrial Bank, at 333 Fourth Avenue. Bartberger was the German-trained son of the prolific German-born Charles F. Bartberger, who in terms of volume was one of Pittsburgh s top architects from the 1850s to the 1880s. Charles M. in turn trained his own son, Edward W. Bartberger, who lived until 1968. Thus, three Bartberger generations practiced architec- ture in Pittsburgh for well over a century. Charles M. Bartberger appears to have thought carefully about eighteenth- century Neoclassical precedents before crafting a Beaux-Arts synthesis for the Industrial Bank. The architectural languages of the Englishman Nicholas Hawksmoor, the Frenchman Claude-Nicholas Ledoux, and the German Peter Speeth seem to predominate. For dramatic effect, Bartberger capri- ciously overscaled elements like the triglyphs, some of which suddenly and irrationally droop down onto the masonry surface.",

    "There are, nonetheless, some worthy survivors. One is the elegant Adam-style Americus Club (now the Pitt Building) at the corner of Allies and Smithfield. Built in 1918 in the English Neoclassical Style of the late eighteenth century, the clubhouse s left side was amputated four years later when the narrow old Second Avenue was transformed into the Boulevard of the Allies. Two other lively survivors stand at 110 and 112 Smithfield.

    "The corner of the PORTRAIT store now standing at Smithfield and Forbes was built for the Kaufmanns in 1898 by Charles Bickel and borrows motifs from the Romanesque and Classical Revivals, as well as from the Chicago school of Louis Henry Sullivan and his colleagues. Edgar Kaufmann Sr. (1885 1955), universally known as E. J., took charge of the firm in 1913 and had the socially prominent architect Benno Janssen design a new terra-cotta block to replace the store built in 1885 at the corner of Smithfield and Fifth. A few years later Kaufmann purchased the first of fifteen hundred acres for a country retreat near Pittsburgh that Frank Lloyd Wright made world famous as Fallingwater. Janssen designed an extension of the store on Forbes Avenue at Cherry Way a few years later. In 1930, he modernized its ground floor interior in Art Deco Style, with piers of black Carrara glass and murals by Boardman Robinson. Critics regarded it as the most beautiful store in America and the most profitable. It marked Kaufmann s first step toward Modernism. The glass and murals are long gone from Kaufmann s Macy s, and so is the office that Wright built for Kaufmann in 1936 and 1937 (contemporary with Fallingwater) on the store s tenth floor.",
    "Wright designed the furniture and paneling for this sumptuous suite, including a cypress plywood mural, and he selected the wall fabrics himself. The office served Kaufmann for twenty years, until his death in 1955, after which his son Edgar Jr. had it dismantled and shipped to London s Victoria and Albert Museum, where it is a star attraction. Architect Benno Janssen (1874 1964) is undeservedly forgotten today, even though a recent biography offers excellent coverage of his body of work. Janssen was born to a German-American family in St. Louis, enrolled at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1902, and soon after came to work in Pittsburgh. He was the best academic designer Pittsburgh ever had, on a par with or superior to Carr√®re Hastings, Horace Trumbauer, David Adler, Charles Platt, and the host of others who took care of wealthy Americans architectural needs before and after World War I.

    "Janssen s career reminds us of Kaufmann s importance as a patron of architecture for many years before he built Fallingwater. Kaufmann commis- 65 sioned buildings from Janssen, Wright, the Bauhaus-associated Richard Neutra (for Kaufmann s Palm Springs winter retreat, the out standing example of American midcentury modernism), Joseph Urban (a swimming pool at the Irene Kaufmann Settlement on the Hill), and the important Pittsburgh archi- tects Mitchell Ritchey (for the Civic Arena in the lower Hill District). After Janssen retired in the 1930s, Kaufmann switched his architectural allegiance to Wright, and together the two men planned Fallingwater in 1934 and 1935. Kaufmann s architectural patronage reminds us in turn of how impor- tant Frank Lloyd Wright (1867 1959) was to Pittsburgh and vice versa. Kaufmann was Wright s outstanding patron. Their partnership lasted twenty years and yielded nearly a dozen uncompleted projects in addition to those that were realized. The unfinished projects included Kaufmann s sponsor- ship of Wright s Broadacre City model, which was exhibited at Kaufmann s immediately after being shown in 1935 at Rockefeller Center Wright s exten- sive sketches for a megastructure at the Point the Rhododendron Chapel, meant to rise on the grounds of Fallingwater another winter house (Wright intended it to outshine the one already built by Neutra) a hillside apartment on Mount Washington and a planetarium and parking garage next to Kaufmann s store.",

The throngs seen in old photographs of Fifth Avenue will never return, but in the meantime, there is heartening progress, with several excellent buildings waiting to be reutilized. The Park Building, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield, is a design triumph by the then-dean of American architects, George B. Post. Completed in 1896, it was the third or fourth of Pittsburgh s steel-frame skyscrapers.

The base is simplified and strong, and the nine identical middle floors are PITTSBURGH A NEW well articulated through corner windows. But the joy of the Park Building is PORTRAIT in the thirty telemones or Atlases that are (seemingly) crushed by the weight of the top cornice. The telemones are cast in terra cotta and were originally poly- chromed. Pittsburgh has always loved them, perhaps because these mytho- logical creatures straining at their work symbolize the hard physical labor that for so long characterized the city s work force. The 300 block of Fifth Avenue, from Smithfield down to Wood Street, was for a century home to another of Pittsburgh s innovative skyscrapers. At 335 Fifth Avenue master piano salesman Samuel Hamilton erected the ten- story Hamilton Building in 1889 to a height of 125 feet. The building was a traditional masonry structure, not steel frame, but it was the last word in late Victorian commercial expression. A few doors down from where the piano skyscraper once stood is the structure that ate it up Piatt Place, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street.",

The earliest of these was One Oliver Plaza, a thirty-eight-story glass-and-steel box standing on a base of dark granite at the Sixth Avenue angle of the trapezoid. At the Fifth Avenue end of the block stands One PNC Plaza, built as the Pittsburgh National Bank Building in 1972. This replaced an Italian Renaissance tower that Daniel Burnham erected for the predeces- sor First National Bank. One PNC Plaza was conceived as a glass slab, with a service core that is clad in pearl-gray granite. It does its job well, but at thirty stories, the current building is merely three floors higher than the 1912 tower it replaced, leading one to question the notion of architectural obsolescence.",
    "Two PNC Plaza was squeezed between the One Oliver and One PNC Plaza towers in 1976. Although handicapped by weak linkage to the streets in front and behind them, the two interlocking mirror-glass octagons of Two PNC manage an elegant solution to an overbuilt site. The octagonal geometry of these twin towers relates well to the polygonal shape of the former Meyer and Jonasson department store, the low-rise neighbor at 606 Liberty Avenue. Meyer and Jonasson got its odd shape because it conformed to the old course of Oliver Avenue before it was filled in below Wood Street.

Mellon s first bank was a masonry building at 514 Smithfield Street, roughly opposite what is now the square, but in 1873, the judge put up a more imposing cast-iron front that featured a statue of his hero, Benjamin Franklin.

The Presbyterians and Episcopalians are still on the block the 76 German and Evangelist congregations are only a few hundred feet away. Sixth Avenue s Trinity Episcopal Cathedral and First Presbyterian Church PITTSBURGH A NEW are both monuments with impeccable design pedigrees. Trinity s first and PORTRAIT second churches of 1787 and 1805 were farther down the block, on Liberty Avenue the third church was built on this site in 1824 by the rector, John Henry Hopkins, who published an engraving of his design locally in 1826, then nationally in his Essay on Gothic Architecture in 1836. The present Trinity Cathedral was designed forty years later by Gordon Lloyd, an English-born architect from Detroit who had been trained both in the archaeological and rhetorical variants of the Gothic Revival. The latter taste manifests itself in the bold massing of the octagonal spire over the Trinity tower.",
    "Inside, the feeling is not English but decidedly American, and the interior assimilates several features of the late style of Richard Upjohn, to whom the church has occa- sionally been attributed. Trinity is a ravishingly austere building inside, with compound piers and archivolts of gray stone standing out against the cream white walls, and deep brown diaphragm arches soar across the nave. If Gordon Lloyd was this good (not even his obituary suggested he was), all honor to him! First Presbyterian Church, on the opposite side of Trinity s graveyard, is the successor church to one that was redesigned and expanded by Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1812 and to a later Gothic Revival design by Charles F. Bartberger at midcentury. The designer of the present building, Theophilus P. Chandler Jr., was a practiced Philadelphia architect with excellent social connections both in that city and in Boston. In Pittsburgh he was the favored architect of the Thaw family, which resulted in commissions to erect three Presbyterian churches. The challenge to Chandler in 1905 was that the church must look good against the backdrop of Trinity while upholding Presby- terianism in the most intensely Presbyterian city in the country.",
    "His response was a much more showy design than Trinity s, with double towers in front and a fantastic march of gables and pinnacles on the side aisle flanking the cemetery. The interior is distinguished by rich and structurally daring wood- work and by fourteen stained-glass windows by Tiffany out standing even in a city that abounds in some of the best stained glass in the country. Remarkable, too, is what looks to be an apse behind the altar but operates as a pair of enormous doors that swing open to provide additional space. 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.

The open-air pulpit in front of First Presbyterian, an unusual Medieval feature, points directly across the street to the most powerful of these neighbors, the Duquesne Club. The club moved to this location in 1879, 77 six years after its founding, and a decade later erected its present Richardsonian Romanesque brownstone fa√ßade. Inside the Duquesne Club are scattered fifty-four dining rooms, mainly private suites maintained by major Pittsburgh corporations.",
    "The role played by the club in the development of Pittsburgh since 1873 can be exaggerated, but not by much. One explanation offered for the peculiar bunching of skyscrapers in certain parts of the Triangle is that the corporate CEOs prefer not to build too far from the Duquesne clubhouse on Sixth Avenue. In a study of civic leadership in Pittsburgh in 1958, Arnold J. Auerbach polled the executive committee of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, with these results twenty-four of the twenty-five members belonged to the Duquesne Club, nineteen to the Mellon-centered Rolling Rock Club at Ligonier, and thirteen to the Fox Chapel Golf Club. Next door to the Duquesne Club is the former German Savings and Deposit Bank, now the Granite Building. This Romanesque Revival bank has to be accounted among the most sumptuously textured buildings in Pittsburgh, though in the end it becomes a fairly tedious catalogue of all the shapes and textures granite can assume. The 300 Sixth Avenue Building, at the corner of Wood, completes the Sixth Avenue sequence as the counterpart terra-cotta slab to the Oliver Building at the top of the block. It served for a generation as McCreery s Department Store, then from the 1940s to the 1960s as the Spear Company store. Not having a particularly strong design to begin with, the building was further compromised by an unsympathetic rehabilitation. The new base did, however, include one superb feature The Puddler, an illuminated stained- glass mural of an ironworker. It was installed in 1942 and today is one of the prime icons of the city. fig. 2.23 The Puddler 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press. All rights reserved. 2009 University of Pittsburgh Press.
