    "Fare Policy Proposal Jan. 1, 2017 Base Fare 2.50 with ConnectCard 1 transfers on ConnectCard 25 cent cash surcharge no paper transfers for cash users Pay-on-enter for buses Eliminate the free Downtown bus zone 2 ConnectCard fee 7 day pass Kid s ConnectCard Second half of 2017 Pay-on enter for light rail Cashless proof-of-payment on light rail In recent years, Port Authority has surveyed several thousand riders who told us that they want to get from point A to point B easier, faster and cheaper. We heard countless stories of people unfamiliar with the system, those visiting from another city and even daily riders who have attempted to board a bus or light rail vehicle not knowing when to pay, where to pay or how to pay. The proposed changes address many of the issues that were brought to our attention, including simplifying the confusing zone system, streamlining the boarding and exiting process, and providing faster, more efficient service. Port Authority anticipates an increase in ridership because of the proposed changes however, the number of additional riders is difficult to estimate with a policy that has so many substantial changes.",
    "Historically, other transit systems have seen a correlation between lowering fares and increasing ridership. Routes will continue to be monitored for overcrowding, and small service adjustments will be made if warranted. Single zone By switching to a single zone system, Port Authority is able to offer one base fare, regardless of distance traveled. This makes traveling more convenient as riders will no longer have to worry about paying extra if they re going from Zone 1 to Zone 2. Port Authority has had some of the highest average base fares in the country for the last several years, and we felt it was unsustainable and irresponsible to simply continue raising fares every few years. The proposal the Board is considering holds the line and, for about a quarter of our riders, reverses that trend for the first time in at least 35 years.The economic makeup of our suburban riders is very similar to our inner-city ridership. This population, however, has had less frequent service and fewer routes to choose from which to choose despite paying 150 percent more than riders traveling to and from Zone 1.",
    "Additionally, a substantial percentage of our riders commute daily from within the city to the suburbs. The flat fare will benefit those riders as well. Pay on enter With a pay-on-enter system, riders will no longer be confused as to when or where they must pay. Most riders will simply pay in the front and exit out the back. This will help with the flow of movement getting on and off the bus. Riders who require use of the accessible ramp at the front of the bus may continue to do so. The free Downtown bus zone will be eliminated due to the pay-on-enter system. The free Downtown North Shore rail zone will remain. Internal data on passenger dwell time after 7 p.m. -- when buses are pay-on-enter Downtown -- show a slight increase in boarding times for some of our highest-capacity routes, however, we expect an overall decrease in the amount of time buses spend waiting for passengers to board and alight. Cash surcharge The majority of our riders -- about 70 percent -- already pay with a ConnectCard, and we believe the 25 cent cash surcharge and availability of electronic-only transfers will get more people using their ConnectCard for the financial incentive.",
    "We also believe this will solve complaints that riders who pay with cash slow down the boarding process. Between the current and new ticket vending kiosks, even riders without ConnectCards will have access to buy ConnecTix for single trip tickets, thereby avoiding the cash surcharge. ConnectCard fee We propose charging 2 for ConnectCards to recoup the production costs. We don t believe 2 is a great hindrance, as it can be recouped in just four round trips. This fee will be charged for new and replacement cards, regardless of where it was purchased and whether or not it is registered. Fees will be waived for malfunctioning cards or cards that have been stolen, with a police report. Transfers Transfers will continue to cost 1 for ConnectCard users. Because paper transfers will be eliminated, cash users will pay full fare for each and every trip.Light Rail The single-zone, flat fare and cash surcharge will apply to light rail on Jan. 1, 2017. Rail surcharges during peak hours will be eliminated, also on Jan. 1, 2017. Once additional ticket vending kiosks and payment validators are installed and the software is upgraded, riders at most stops will pay before boarding the light rail vehicle.",
    "Riders at low-platform stops will tap their ConnectCard upon boarding the light rail vehicle. Our technical support team is currently scouting locations for new ticket vending kiosks. Ideally, these kiosks would be placed at every stop along both the Blue Line and Red Line, but access to infrastructure may make 100 percent coverage logistically impossible or financially impractical. Existing and new ticket vending kiosks will dispense both ConnectCards and ConnecTix. ConnectCards will also be available through our website and mailed to customers. After additional payment validators and ticket vending kiosks are installed, some stations will feature specially-marked areas where those inside will have already paid their fare. Fare enforcement Port Authority will hire additional police officers who will, in part, check to make sure riders have paid their fare while in the pay zones or on board vehicles. Passengers will, at random, be required to show proof that they have paid while in these areas or on board. We believe pay-on-enter and the cashless proof-of-payment method will reduce fare evasion and contribute to higher revenue collection. Currently, fare evasion is currently at about 8 percent. Fines for fare evasion are generally between 50 and 300, plus court costs. The only money Port Authority receives is restitution for our loss, or the cost of the ride ( 2.50). Additional products Port Authority will offer a day pass for 7. If you know your rides for a day will cost more than 7, we suggest buying a day pass. Port Authority is working with our software developer to roll out a Kids ConnectCard that will allow riders ages 6-11 to ride for a half fare. These cards, which will also cost 2, will be available at our Downtown Service Center, and like our other half-fare products, will require an application process. Riders under six will continue to ride for free. We will also offer half-fare weekly and half-fare monthly products for eligible riders who have successfully completed the application process. Riders who receive paper tickets through local agencies may instead receive single-trip ConnecTix, which work the same way and can be disposed of after alighting the vehicle."
