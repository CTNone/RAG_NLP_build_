The Pirates compete in\nMajor League Baseball\n(MLB) as a member club of the\nNational League\n(NL)\nCentral Division\n. Founded as part of the\nAmerican Association\nin 1881 under the name the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the\nNational League East\nfrom 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five\nWorld Series\nchampionships, nine\nNational League pennants\n, nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the\nWild Card Game\n.\nThe Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the\ninaugural World Series\nin 1903 and winning their first title in\n1909\nbehind\nHonus Wagner\n. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the\n1960 World Series\nagainst the\nNew York Yankees\non a\nwalk-off home run\nby\nBill Mazeroski\n, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in\n1971\nbehind\nRoberto Clemente\n, the first Latin-American enshrined in the\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame\n, and in\n1979\nunder the leadership of\nWillie Stargell\n.\nSince their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from\n1993\nto\n2012\n, a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.\n[\n5\n]\nThe Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,\n[\n6\n]\nand the longest\nLeague Championship Series\nappearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of\n10,839–10,819–140\n(.500 winning 'percentage').\n[\n7\n]\nThe Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from\nbuccaneer\n, a synonym for\npirate\n). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at\nPNC Park\n, a 39,000-seat stadium along the\nAllegheny River\nin Pittsburgh's\nNorth Side\n. The Pirates previously played at\nForbes Field\nfrom 1909 to 1970 and at\nThree Rivers Stadium\nfrom 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the\nflag of Pittsburgh\nand matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the\nSteelers\nand the\nPenguins\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of the Pittsburgh Pirates\nProfessional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the\nAllegheny Base Ball Club\n, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called\nAllegheny City\n, across the\nAllegheny River\nfrom Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league\nInternational Association\nin 1877, only to fold the following season.\n[\n8\n]\nOn October 15, 1881,\nDenny McKnight\nheld a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,\n[\n9\n]\nwhich began play in 1882 as a founding member of the\nAmerican Association\n. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,\n[\n10\n]\nthe team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (occasionally the \"Alleghenies\" or “Allies”) in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mostly mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first\nA.A. team\nto switch to the older\nNational League\nin 1887.\n[\n11\n]\nDuring the winter prior to the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the\nPlayers' League\n's\nPittsburgh Burghers\n. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also signed highly regarded second baseman\nLou Bierbauer\n, who had previously played with the A.A.'s\nPhiladelphia Athletics\n. Although the Athletics failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\".\n[\n12\n]\nThis incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" from newspapers around the country, starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with even Pittsburgh newspapers.\n[\n13\n]\nThe nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912.\nThe\n1909 Pirates\nin a poster celebrating their National League pennant.\nFrank Chance\nof Chicago and\nJohn McGraw\nof  New York, two teams the Pirates beat for the pennant, are being made to\nwalk the plank\n.\nEarly on, the Pirates organization finished no higher than 2nd in either league’s standings, but their fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the\nLouisville Colonels\n, who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.)\n[\n14\n]\nAmong those players was\nHonus Wagner\n, who would become one of the first players inducted to the\nBaseball Hall of Fame\n. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in\nthe first modern World Series ever played\n, which they lost to\nBoston\n. The Pirates returned to the World Series in\n1909\n, defeating the\nDetroit Tigers\nfor their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from\nExposition Park\nto one of the first steel and concrete ballparks,\nForbes Field\n.\nAs Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder\nMax Carey\nand young players\nPie Traynor\nand\nKiki Cuyler\n, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in\n1925\n, becoming the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the World Series.\n[\n15\n]\nThe Pirates returned to the World Series in\n1927\nbut were swept by the\nMurderer's Row\nYankees\n. The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the\nChicago Cubs\nin the\nfinal week of the season\n.\nDespite the prowess of\nRalph Kiner\nas a slugger during the latter half of the stretch, the Pirates were mostly undistinguished in the 1940s, and downright awful in the early 1950s.\nBranch Rickey\nwas brought in during this time to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in\n1960\n. They were largely outscored over the course of the series by the\nYankees\n, yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by\nBill Mazeroski\nin the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history.\nLed by right fielder\nRoberto Clemente\n, the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until\n1971\n. Playing in the new\nThree Rivers Stadium\n, the Pirates defeated the favored\nBaltimore Orioles\nbehind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of\nSteve Blass\n. In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup.\n[\n16\n]\nDespite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created\nNational League East\nin\n1970\n,\n1971\n,\n1972\n,\n1974\n,\n1975\n, and\n1979\n. Powered by sluggers such as\nWillie Stargell\n,\nDave Parker\n, and\nAl Oliver\n, the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the\ndisco\nsong\n\"We Are Family\"\n(which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3–1 deficit to once again defeat the\nOrioles\nin the\n1979 World Series\nfor the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis).\nPittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990.\nThe Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like\nBarry Bonds\n,\nBobby Bonilla\n, and\nDoug Drabek\n. The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the\nNational League Championship Series\neach time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in\n1992\n. Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season.\nAndrew McCutchen\n, 2012\nWith salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001,\nPNC Park\n, did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in\n2013\nbehind National League MVP\nAndrew McCutchen\n, defeating the\nCincinnati Reds\nin the\nWild Card Game\n. They were eliminated in five games in the\nnext round\nby the\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n. That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins.\n[\n17\n]\nOn\nOpening Day\n2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th\n[\n18\n]\nmaking the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n,\nAtlanta Braves\n, and the Chicago Cubs.\n[\n19\n]\nThe Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then.\nBallpark\n[\nedit\n]\nSince 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at\nPNC Park\n, located on the banks of the\nAllegheny River\nin Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging\nThree Rivers Stadium\n, a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics.\n[\n20\n]\nFunded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based\nPNC Financial Services\n.\n[\n21\n]\nPNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the\n2015 National League Wild Card Game\n, when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4–0.\nPNC Park prior to a game in 2014\nWidely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel façade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nPNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953;\n[\n26\n]\nas a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher,\n[\n27\n]\nand seating along the baselines is 45 feet  from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder\nRoberto Clemente\n, who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente,\nWillie Stargell\n,\nBill Mazeroski\nand\nHonus Wagner\nare located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the\n2006 MLB All-Star Game\nand has been the site of several concerts.\nPNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from\ndowntown Pittsburgh\nvia the\nClemente Bridge\n, or take\nPittsburgh Light Rail\nto the system's\nNorth Side station\n, located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance.\nFormer ballparks\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Pirates' first home was\nExposition Park\n, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and\nRecreation Park\n, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the middle of the 1909 season.\n[\n28\n]\nThe park hosted the\nfirst modern World Series ever played\nin 1903, but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.\n[\n29\n]\nThe site, currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, is marked by a state historical marker (near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive) and a sunken home plate marker made of steel (a few paces away, in the parking lot) , both noting the 1903 World Series.\nForbes Field\n, the Pirates' home ballpark from 1909 to 1970\nIn the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into\nForbes Field\nin\nOakland\n, which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation.\n[\n30\n]\nForbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheap\nhome runs\nand vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field.\n[\n31\n]\nWhen a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected.\n[\n32\n]\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nDespite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of\nBabe Ruth\n's career on May 25, 1935\n[\n35\n]\nand Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the\n1960 World Series\n. The park also hosted\nfootball\ngames for the\nPittsburgh Steelers\nand\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n\"Pitt\" Panthers\n. Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's\nPosvar Hall\n.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nThe Pirates moved into the multipurpose\nThree Rivers Stadium\nin 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other\nmulti-purpose stadiums\npopular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and\nStage AE\n, although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near\nAcrisure Stadium\n. In 2012, members of the\nSociety for American Baseball Research\nmarked and painted the\nhome plate\nand first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit.\n[\n38\n]\nSince then, markers have been placed at the locations of home plate, second base, and the pitcher’s plate.\nLECOM Park\n, which hosts the Pirates' Spring Training games\nSpring Training\n[\nedit\n]\nSince 1969, the Pirates have held\nSpring Training\nat\nLECOM Park\nin\nBradenton, Florida\n, which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the\nBradenton Marauders\n. Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only\nJackie Robinson Ballpark\nin\nDaytona Beach\n, which dates to 1914.\n[\n39\n]\nIt is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after\nFenway Park\n, built in 1912, and\nWrigley Field\n, built in 1914.\n[\n40\n]\nBuilt in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights.\n[\n41\n]\nThe park was formerly named \"McKechnie Field,\" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great\nBill McKechnie\n, who led the Pirates in\n1925\n; since 2017 it has been named for the\nLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine\n, which has its main campus in\nErie, Pennsylvania\n, and also a campus in Bradenton.\n[\n42\n]\nPirate City\n, the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park.\nLogos and uniforms\n[\nedit\n]\n1888: \"Alleghenys\" Logo\n1900–1906\n1907\n1908–1909\n1915–1919\n1921, 1932\n1922\n1923–1931\n1933–1935\n1948–present\nUniform design in the 1940s\nThe Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century.\n[\n43\n]\nDuring this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket.\n[\n43\n]\nThe team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942.\n[\n43\n]\nIn 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the\nFlag of Pittsburgh\nand, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown\nPittsburgh Steelers\nof the\nNational Football League\n. The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924,\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nbut the change did not last beyond that season.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\nAlong with the\nSan Francisco Giants\n, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion\nNational League\nteams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009.\nIn the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the\nCincinnati Reds\n), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into\nThree Rivers Stadium\nin 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit).\n[\n43\n]\nThe Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.\nWillie Stargell\nwearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native\nFred Rogers\nIn 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal\npinstripes\n. After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear\nthird jerseys\n, following the\nOakland Athletics\n. Starting in\n1977\n, the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the\n1979 World Series\n. The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since.\n[\n43\n]\nAfter\nKevin McClatchy\npurchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In\n2009\n, the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road.\n[\n43\n]\nFrom 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019.\n[\n49\n]\nSince the\n2015 season\n, the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games.\n[\n50\n]\nThe camouflage alternates were updated for the\n2018 season\n, now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches.\n[\n51\n]\nAhead of the\n2020 season\n, the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow.\n[\n52\n]\nIn addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park.\nIn 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a\nCity Connect\nuniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\".

During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the two\nNational League East\ndivision rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n58\n]\n[\n59\n]\nThe Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.\n[\n58\n]\nAfter the Pirates moved to the\nNational League Central\nin 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.\n[\n55\n]\n[\n56\n]\nHowever, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between\nEastern\nand\nWestern Pennsylvania\nstill fueling the rivalry.\n[\n60\n]\nCincinnati Reds\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPirates-Reds rivalry\nThe Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the\nCincinnati Reds\n, given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities'\nfootball rivalry\n, and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason,\n[\n61\n]\nmost recently in the\n2013 National League Wild Card Game\n. In the 2010s, the two teams frequently\nhit each other with pitches\n, occasionally resulting in brawls.\n[\n62\n]\nDivisional foes\n[\nedit\n]\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the\nSt. Louis Cardinals\nfor the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the\n2013 National League Division Series\n, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious\n[\n63\n]\nbattle with the\nMilwaukee Brewers\nfor a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the\nChicago Cubs\nin the\n2015 National League Wild Card Game\n. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of\nthe 1938 season\n.\nInterleague\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Pirates play an annual\ninterleague\nseries against the\nDetroit Tigers\n. While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the\nNational Hockey League\n's\nDetroit Red Wings\nand\nPittsburgh Penguins\n. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36–29. The two teams played in the\n1909 World Series\n.\nAn on-and-off rivalry with the\nCleveland Guardians\nstems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the\nlongstanding rivalry\nin the\nNational Football League\nbetween the\nCleveland Browns\nand\nPittsburgh Steelers\n. Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically.  The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule.  The Pirates lead the series 21–19.\n[\n64\n]\nRoster\n[\nedit\n]\nPittsburgh Pirates roster\nv\nt\ne\nActive roster\nInactive roster\nCoaches / other\nPitchers\nStarting rotation\n6\nBailey Falter\n45\nAndrew Heaney\n23\nMitch Keller\n50\nCarmen Mlodzinski\n30\nPaul Skenes\nBullpen\n51\nDavid Bednar\n43\nRyan Borucki\n64\nCaleb Ferguson\n35\nColin Holderman\n27\nTanner Rainey\n60\nDennis Santana\n55\nChase Shugart\n34\nJoey Wentz\nCatchers\n14\nJoey Bart\n32\nHenry Davis\nInfielders\n26\nAdam Frazier\n13\nKe'Bryan Hayes\n7\nIsiah Kiner-Falefa\n19\nJared Triolo\nOutfielders\n3\nJi-hwan Bae\n29\nAlexander Canario\n15\nOneil Cruz\n62\nMatt Gorski\n28\nTommy Pham\n10\nBryan Reynolds\nDesignated hitters\n22\nAndrew McCutchen\nPitchers\n67\nBraxton Ashcraft\n53\nMike Burrows\n78\nThomas Harrington\n66\nKyle Nicolas\n63\nHunter Stratton\nCatchers\n5\nEndy Rodríguez\nInfielders\n71\nTsung-Che Cheng\n25\nBilly Cook\n39\nNick Gonzales\n2\nSpencer Horwitz\n31\nLiover Peguero\n48\nEnmanuel Valdez\n38\nNick Yorke\nOutfielders\n65\nJack Suwinski\nManager\n12\nDon Kelly\nCoaches\n16\nTarrik Brock\n(first base)\n82\nJordan Comadena\n(bullpen catcher)\n86\nRadley Haddad\n(game planning/strategy)\n52\nMatt Hague\n(hitting)\n90\nRaul Hernandez\n(bullpen catcher)\n96\nMendy López\n(infield)\n47\nOscar Marin\n(pitching)\n88\nChristian Marrero\n(assistant hitting)\n95\nStephen Morales\n(coach / translator)\n87\nMiguel Pérez\n(bullpen)\n58\nMike Rabelo\n(third base)\n56\nBrent Strom\n(assistant pitching)\n98\nJonny Tucker\n(coach)\n60-day injured list\n37\nJared Jones\n61\nJustin Lawrence\n18\nTim Mayza\n36\nDauri Moreta\n24\nJohan Oviedo\n26 active, 14 inactive\n7-, 10-, or 15-day\ninjured list\n#\nPersonal leave\nRoster\nand\ncoaches\nupdated May 12, 2025\nTransactions\n•\nDepth chart\n→\nAll MLB rosters\nPlayers of note\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nPittsburgh Pirates award winners and league leaders\nHall of Famer\nRoberto Clemente\ncollected 3,000 hits and was named\nWorld Series MVP\nin 1971\nHall of Famer\nRalph Kiner\nled the NL in home runs for seven straight seasons (1946–1952)\nHall of Famer\nBill Mazeroski\nhit a ninth-inning walk-off home run that decided the 1960 World Series\nHall of Famer\nWillie Stargell\nwas named\nWorld Series MVP\nin 1979\nHonus Wagner\nis considered to be one of the greatest shortstops of all time and was a member of the\nMLB Hall of Fame's Inaugural Class in 1936\n.

These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass \"\nminer's cap\n\". This was the mandate of general manager\nBranch Rickey\n, who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game.\n[\n87\n]\nIn 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a helmet with the comfort of a baseball cap.\n[\n88\n]\nThe cap would prove widely unpopular, with only\nAlex Torres\nof the\nNew York Mets\nchoosing to wear it.\n[\n89\n]\nFirst franchise to win a World Series on a\nhome run\n(\n1960 World Series\n) in the 7th game. The only other team to accomplish this feat is the\nToronto Blue Jays\nin\n1993\n, though theirs came in Game 6.\nIn\n1970\nthe Pirates became the first major league club to create their uniforms using a cotton-nylon blend featuring pull-over shirts and beltless pants.\n[\n90\n]\nThe first all-minority lineup in MLB history took the field on September 1, 1971.\n[\n91\n]\nThe lineup was\nRennie Stennett\n,\nGene Clines\n,\nRoberto Clemente\n,\nWillie Stargell\n,\nManny Sanguillén\n,\nDave Cash\n,\nAl Oliver\n,\nJackie Hernández\n, and\nDock Ellis\n.\n[\n92\n]\nThe first World Series night game was played in\nThree Rivers Stadium\non October 13, 1971—\neleven years to the day since Mazeroski's walk-off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960\n. In this case, however, it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, rather than a decisive Game 7. Apparently, good things happen for the Pirates on this date, as they knotted the\n1971 World Series\nat two games apiece on their way to their fourth title.\nThe first MLB scout to win the \"Scout of the Year Award\",\nHowie Haak\n, in 1984, three additional scouts from the organization have subsequently won the award.\nThe first combined\nextra inning\nno-hitter\nin MLB history took place at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1997.\nFrancisco Córdova\n(9 innings) and\nRicardo Rincón\n(1 inning) combined to no-hit the\nHouston Astros\n, 3–0 in 10 innings.\nPinch-hitter\nMark Smith's\nthree-run\nwalk-off home run\nin the bottom of the 10th inning sealed the victory and the no-hitter for the Pirates. It remains the only such no-hitter to date.\n[\n93\n]\nIn November 2008, the Pirates became the first MLB team to sign Indian players when they acquired the non-draft free agents of\nRinku Singh\nand\nDinesh Patel\n.\n[\n94\n]\n[\n95\n]\nThis was also seen by Pirates\ngeneral manager\nNeal Huntington\n, as \"not only add[ing] two prospects to our system but also hope to open a pathway to an untapped market.\"\n[\n96\n]\nThe Pirates are the first team in professional sports to have 20 consecutive losing seasons. This streak lasted from 1993 to 2012. This is the longest such streak in North American professional sports history.\nThe Pirates are the first MLB team (as well as only second in major professional sports) to be owned by an\nopenly gay\nowner, although\nKevin McClatchy\nhad already divested his shares in the Pirates when he openly announced his homosexuality in September 2012.\n[\n97\n]\n[\n98\n]\nOn April 6, 2015, the Pirates' loss to the\nCincinnati Reds\nearned the team its 10,000 franchise loss and making the Pirates the first MLB team to reach their 10,000th loss on an Opening Day.\n[\n18\n]\nOn May 9, 2015, the Pirates became the first MLB team to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The triple play occurred during a 7–5 win over the\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n. The play occurred when the Cardinals'\nYadier Molina\nlined out to Pittsburgh second baseman\nNeil Walker\n. Walker then threw to third baseman\nJung Ho Kang\nto double off the Cardinals'\nJhonny Peralta\nfor the second out. Kang then threw the ball back to Walker, who was standing on second base for the final out after St. Louis's\nJason Heyward\nfroze between second and third.\n[\n99\n]\nOn April 24, 2017, the Pirates fielded the first baseball player to be born and raised in\nLithuania\n, to reach the major leagues,\nDovydas Neverauskas\n. In 1933,\nJoe Zapustas\nwas the first Lithuanian-born player to play in MLB, as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics, however, he grew up in Boston.\n[\n100\n]\nOn April 26, 2017, the Pirates promoted\nSouth African\nGift Ngoepe\nfrom the AAA\nIndianapolis Indians\n; making him the first African-born player in MLB history.\n[\n101\n]\nOn August 23, 2017, the Pirates became the first team in MLB history to break up a no-hitter in extra innings with a\nwalk-off home run\n. The home run was hit by\nJosh Harrison\nin the tenth inning, off pitcher\nRich Hill\n, to give the Pirates a 1–0 win over the\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n.\n[\n102\n]\nMinor league affiliations\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nList of Pittsburgh Pirates minor league affiliates\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates\nfarm system\nconsists of seven\nminor league\naffiliates.\n[\n103\n]\nClass\nTeam\nLeague\nLocation\nBallpark\nAffiliated\nTriple-A\nIndianapolis Indians\nInternational League\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nVictory Field\n2005\nDouble-A\nAltoona Curve\nEastern League\nAltoona, Pennsylvania\nPeoples Natural Gas Field\n1999\nHigh-A\nGreensboro Grasshoppers\nSouth Atlantic League\nGreensboro, North Carolina\nFirst National Bank Field\n2019\nSingle-A\nBradenton Marauders\nFlorida State League\nBradenton, Florida\nLECOM Park\n2010\nRookie\nFCL Pirates\nFlorida Complex League\nBradenton, Florida\nPirate City Complex\n1969\nDSL Pirates Black\nDominican Summer League\nBoca Chica\n,\nSanto Domingo\nPirates Academy\n2018\nDSL Pirates Gold\nCivil rights advocacy\n[\nedit\n]\nThroughout the 1940s Pirates owner\nWilliam Benswanger\nwas a leading advocate of integration of the Major Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club.\n[\n104\n]\nThe Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when\nGene Baker\nbroke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963, the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh.\n[\n105\n]\nOn September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minority players for the first time in MLB history.\n[\n106\n]\nFanbase\n[\nedit\n]\nBing Crosby\nco-owned the Pirates from 1946 until his death in 1977.\nEven though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner\nBing Crosby\n,\nMichael Keaton\n, and\nRegis Philbin\n,\n[\n107\n]\nthe Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the\nPittsburgh Steelers\nand\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin popularity among Pittsburgh's three\nmajor professional sports teams\n.\n[\n108\n]\nHowever, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in\n2013\n, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century.\nWhile the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the\nSuper Bowl\n3 times (\nXIV\n,\nXL\n, and\nXLIII\n) and the Penguins the\nStanley Cup\nfive times in\n1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017\n, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,\n[\n109\n]\nthe\nPittsburgh drug trials\nin 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.\n[\n110\n]\nThe team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of\nPNC Park\nin 2001.\n[\n111\n]\nFollowing the\nAndrew McCutchen\ntrade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner\nRobert Nutting\n, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.\n[\n112\n]\nWhen the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain\nSidney Crosby\nbrought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in\nDetroit\n. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home\nThree Rivers Stadium\n.\nCommunity activities\n[\nedit\n]\nEach year, the Pirates recognize six \"Community Champions\" during a special pregame ceremony.\n[\n113\n]\nPiratefest\nis a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, \"Ask Pirates Management\", and appearances by the\nPirate Parrot\n. Piratefest was once held at the\nDavid L. Lawrence Convention Center\nin downtown Pittsburgh\n[\n114\n]\nbut is now held annually at the ballpark.\nMedia\n[\nedit\n]\nFurther information:\nPittsburgh Pirates Radio Network\nand\nList of Pittsburgh Pirates broadcasters\nRadio and TV\n[\nedit\n]\nMap of Pirate radio affiliates\nThe Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio on August 5, 1921.\nHarold Arlin\n, a foreman at\nWestinghouse\n, announced the game over\nKDKA\nfrom a box seat next to the first base\ndugout\nat\nForbes Field\n.\n[\n115\n]\n[\n116\n]\nKDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with\nRosey Rowswell\nbecoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936.\n[\n117\n]\nExcept for a few years on\nWWSW\nin the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt\nclear channel\nenabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games.\nIn 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM\ntalk radio\nstation\nWPGB\n. The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that\nClear Channel Communications\nholds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.\n[\n118\n]\nOn October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to\nCBS Radio\nvia FM\nsports radio\nstation\nKDKA-FM\n,\n[\n119\n]\nwhich became official on October 12.\n[\n120\n]\nOn March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM.\n[\n121\n]\nAs part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with\nPittsburgh Panthers\nfootball and men's basketball.\n[\n122\n]\nGames are televised on\nSportsNet Pittsburgh\n, the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. The network is majority owned by\nFenway Sports Group\n, owners of the\nBoston Red Sox\nand\nPittsburgh Penguins\n. The Pirates became joint owners of the channel on December 16, 2023, with operations to be produced by the Red Sox's home network\nNESN\n.\n[\n123\n]\nDuring the 2016 season, the Pirates averaged a 7.22 rating and 83,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts.\n[\n124\n]\nApart from any Pirates games aired nationally on Fox, there has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002. Previously,\nKDKA-TV\naired Pirates games for 38 years (1957–1994). Games also aired on\nWPXI\n(1995–1996) and on\nWPGH-TV\nand WCWB (1997–2002).\nAnnouncers\n[\nedit\n]\nCurrent\nThe Pirates have no set broadcast team for radio or TV; instead, all announcers and analysts take turns working in both mediums over the course of a season. The longest-tenured broadcasters are play-by-play announcer\nGreg Brown\nand analyst\nBob Walk\n, both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native\nJohn Wehner\njoined the crew in 2005 as an analyst,\n[\n125\n]\nwhile\nJoe Block\nbecame the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the\nMilwaukee Brewers\n.\n[\n126\n]\nFormer Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include\nMatt Capps\n,\nKevin Young\n, and\nNeil Walker\n.\nPast\nWestinghouse Electric foreman\nHarold Arlin\ncalled the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the\nteleprinter\n, usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by\nBob Prince\nin 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955.\n[\n127\n]\nPrince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nNicknamed \"The Gunner,\" Prince was known for his \"Gunnerisms\"—nicknames and quips—and created the\nGreen Weenie\nin 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in\n1960\nand\n1971\nas part of the national broadcast for\nNBC\n.\nPrince and his broadcast partner\nNellie King\nwere fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase.\nMilo Hamilton\nand\nLanny Frattare\ntook over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince.\n[\n130\n]\nHamilton left to join the\nChicago Cubs\nafter the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by\nTim Neverett\n, who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015.\n[\n131\n]\nFormer analysts include\nDon Hoak\n,\nNelson Briles\n, and\nJim Rooker\n. Former Pirate pitcher\nSteve Blass\n, who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.\n[\n132\n]\nFigures with broadcasting resumés\n[\nedit\n]\nNellie Briles\nSteve Blass\nJoe Garagiola\nRalph Kiner\nBob Walk\nJohn Wehner\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nBaseball portal\nPittsburgh portal\nPennsylvania portal\nList of Pittsburgh Pirates seasons\nGreen Weenie\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"Pirates Uniforms and Logos\"\n.\nPirates.com\n.\nMLB Advanced Media\n.
