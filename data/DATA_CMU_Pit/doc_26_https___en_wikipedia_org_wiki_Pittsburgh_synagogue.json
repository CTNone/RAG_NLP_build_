The congregation, along with New Light Congregation and Congregation Dor Hadash, which also worshipped in the building, was attacked during\nShabbat\nmorning services\n. The perpetrator killed eleven people and wounded six, in the deadliest attack on a local\nJewish community\nin American history.\n[\n7\n]\nThe perpetrator, 46-year-old Robert Gregory Bowers,\n[\n8\n]\nwas shot multiple times by police and arrested at the scene.\n[\n9\n]\nBowers had earlier posted antisemitic comments against\nHIAS\n(formerly, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) on the online\nalt-tech\nsocial network\nGab\n.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nDor Hadash\n[\n13\n]\nhad participated in HIAS's National Refugee Shabbat the previous week. Referring to\nCentral American migrant caravans\nand\nimmigrants\n, Bowers posted a message on Gab in which he wrote that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"\n[\n14\n]\nHe was charged with 63 federal crimes, some of them\ncapital crimes\n.\n[\n9\n]\nBowers pleaded not guilty.\n[\n9\n]\nIn 2023, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death by lethal injection.\n[\n15\n]\nBackground\n[\nedit\n]\nTree of Life – Or L'Simcha Congregation is a\nConservative Jewish\nsynagogue. The synagogue describes itself as a \"traditional,\nprogressive\n, and\negalitarian\ncongregation\".\n[\n16\n]\nIt is located in the\nSquirrel Hill\nneighborhood of\nPittsburgh\n,\nPennsylvania\n, about 5 miles (8.0 km) east of\ndowntown Pittsburgh\n.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nThe Squirrel Hill neighborhood is one of the largest predominantly Jewish neighborhoods in the United States and has historically been the center of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. About 26 percent of the city's Jewish population live in the area.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nOriginally founded as an\nOrthodox Jewish\ncongregation in 1864 in downtown Pittsburgh, by an early group of Jewish immigrants, Tree of Life merged in 2010 with the recently founded Congregation Or L'Simcha.\n[\n21\n]\nThe modern synagogue building, located at the intersection of Wilkins and Shady avenues in Squirrel Hill, was built in 1953. The congregation also rents space to Dor Hadash,\n[\nc\n]\na\nReconstructionist\ncongregation; and New Light, another Conservative congregation.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nThe synagogue's main\nsanctuary\nhas a capacity of 1,250 people.\n[\n25\n]\nSquirrel Hill has a low crime rate and is not generally regarded as racially tense. However, local\nrabbinic student Neal Rosenblum was murdered\nin the neighborhood in 1986 in an\nantisemitic\nhate crime\n.\n[\n26\n]\nThis 2018 mass shooting took place soon after\nColumbia University\nand the\nAnti-Defamation League\nindependently reported a spike in antisemitic activity online, especially on the popular social networking platforms\nInstagram\nand\nTwitter\n.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn addition, other antisemitic acts had been committed elsewhere.\n[\n31\n]\nThe immediate rise in the months of August to October 2018 was attributed to rising tensions associated with advertising for the\n2018 U.S. midterm elections\n.\n[\n32\n]\nA similar rise in online attacks had occurred during the\n2016 US election\n,\n[\n27\n]\nwith the midterms being a \"rallying point\" for far-right extremists to organize efforts to spread antisemitism online among the populace.\n[\n28\n]\nIn 2017, there was a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States,\n[\n30\n]\n[\n29\n]\nin context of rising hate crimes against other groups, including\nMuslims\nand\nAfrican Americans\n, as reported by the FBI.\n[\n30\n]\nFor instance, hundreds of Jewish gravestones were vandalized in Pennsylvania and Missouri,\n[\n28\n]\nand antisemitic incidents on university campuses doubled in number.\n[\n31\n]\nIn August 2017, the widely publicized\nUnite the Right rally\nin\nCharlottesville, Virginia\nfeatured\nNazi symbols\n,\nsalutes\n, and the slogan \"\nBlood and Soil\n\",\n[\n31\n]\namong other racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Considerable antisemitic material was being spread online via\nconspiracy theories\nabout wealthy Jewish individuals, including billionaire\nGeorge Soros\n. Columbia University's Jon Albright said that these represented the \"worst sample\" of all the hate speech he had seen on Instagram.\n[\n27\n]\nShooting\n[\nedit\n]\nAt 9:45 a.m.\nEDT\n(13:45\nUTC\n), three religious services were underway in the Tree of Life synagogue, which housed three distinct congregations. Tree of Life and New Light had both begun independent Shabbat\nmorning service\nin the Pervin Chapel\n[\n33\n]\nand basement, respectively. The Dor Hadash congregants were gathered near the front of the building, prior to their 10:00 a.m.\nTorah study\nsession.\n[\n34\n]\nFive minutes later, a gunman, identified as Robert Bowers and described as a \"bearded heavy-set white male\", entered the building, opened fire and was \"shooting for about 20 minutes.\"\n[\n35\n]\nHe was armed with a\nColt AR-15\nsemi-automatic rifle\n(cited by authorities as an \"assault rifle\")\n[\n3\n]\nand three\nGlock\n.357 SIG\nsemi-automatic pistols\n, all four of which he fired, according to authorities.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n36\n]\n[\n17\n]\n[\n37\n]\nThere would typically be around 75 people in the building on a Saturday morning.\n[\n33\n]\nThe first two persons shot were two brothers, Cecil and David Rosenthal, at the main entrance, after which Bowers headed downstairs to New Light. Some hearing the shots did not initially recognize them for what they were: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, located upstairs, thought a coat rack had fallen and clattered.\n[\n38\n]\nBy 9:54, police began receiving multiple calls from people barricaded in the building and reporting the attack.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\n[\n41\n]\nAt 9:55,\n[\n42\n]\nMelvin Wax, the leader of New Light's services, hid in a pitch-black closet in the basement. He opened the door of the closet, and Bowers immediately shot him. The latter did not notice the other three congregants who remained in the closet. Two other members of New Light, Gottfried and Stein, were shot and killed in the basement kitchen.\n[\n33\n]\nBowers also killed Jerry Rabinowitz of Dor Hadash, a physician who had gone toward the sound of gunshots to see if anyone had been hurt.\n[\n33\n]\nAt 9:57,\n[\n42\n]\nBowers left the basement and headed upstairs to the larger Tree of Life service. About 13 worshippers had gathered for the Shabbat service in an upstairs chapel. Myers helped four of them evacuate the chapel through a side door, but eight of the worshippers remained behind. Bowers killed seven of them and wounded the eighth.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n43\n]\nPolice sources said Bowers shouted at some point during the attack, \"All Jews must die!\"\n[\n39\n]\n[\n44\n]\nAt 9:59, police arrived at the synagogue.\n[\n40\n]\n[\n45\n]\nBowers fired on police from the entryway while apparently departing, and police returned fire, forcing him to retreat into the building.\n[\n33\n]\n[\n46\n]\nA half-hour later, tactical teams entered the building, and Bowers also fired upon them. When officers wounded him in return fire, he retreated to the third floor and hid in a room.\n[\n40\n]\nHe had wounded two officers and two\nSWAT\nmembers, one of them critically.\n[\n46\n]\nAt 11:08, Bowers crawled out of the room and surrendered, having been shot multiple times.\n[\n47\n]\nAs he received medical care in police custody, he allegedly told a SWAT officer that he wanted Jews to die and that Jews were committing genocide against his people.\n[\n48\n]\nBowers discharged his rifle 67 times during the shooting.\n[\n49\n]\nVictims\n[\nedit\n]\nMemorials to victims outside the Tree of Life synagogue\nPlaque listing the victims' names. By the\n9/11 Living Memorial Plaza\nin\nJerusalem\nEleven people were killed,\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\n[\n52\n]\nincluding three on the ground level and four in the synagogue's basement.\n[\n53\n]\nAmong the dead were two brothers and a married couple.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n54\n]\nAt least six others were injured, including four\nPittsburgh Police\nofficers.\n[\n55\n]\n[\n39\n]\nFive people were transported to\nUPMC Presbyterian Hospital\n, four requiring surgery, while one was treated and released by the afternoon. Another victim was transported to\nUPMC Mercy\n, while the accused was taken to\nAllegheny General Hospital\n.\n[\n56\n]\nThose killed were:\nJoyce Fienberg, 75, a retired University of Pittsburgh research specialist\nRichard Gottfried, 65, a dentist\nRose Mallinger, 97, an active congregant at the synagogue for more than 60 years\nJerry Rabinowitz, 65, a family physician\nCecil, 59 & David Rosenthal, 54, brothers who lived together at a community home for people with disabilities\nBernice, 84 & Sylvan Simon, 86, a retired couple who celebrated their wedding at Tree of Life in 1956\nDaniel Stein, 71, a retired salesman and substitute school teacher\nMelvin Wax, 87, a retired accountant who was leading services at the time of the shooting\nIrving Younger, 69, a retired real estate company owner, who served as a greeter at the synagogue\nSeven others were injured in the incident, which included three other congregants and four Pittsburgh officers (two patrol officers and two SWAT officers; three by ricocheted gunfire and another by glass fragments).\n[\n33\n]\nPerpetrator\n[\nedit\n]\nRobert Bowers\n(born September 4, 1972),\n[\n57\n]\na resident of\nBaldwin, Pennsylvania\n, was arrested as the shooter.\n[\n58\n]\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBowers' parents divorced when he was about one year old.\n[\n61\n]\nWhile Bowers was seven years old, his father, Randall G. Bowers of the Pittsburgh neighborhood of\nGarfield\n, died by suicide on October 15, 1979 at the age of 26 while he was awaiting trial on a rape charge in connection of an April 27, 1979 rape of a 20-year-old woman in\nSquirrel Hill\n.\n[\n61\n]\n[\n62\n]\n[\n63\n]\nAuthorities confirmed that his body, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest, was found under a picnic table near the\nTionesta Dam\nin\nTionesta, Pennsylvania\nwith antidepressant drugs next to him. Police also recovered his\n.22 caliber\nrifle at the scene.\n[\n64\n]\nBowers's mother was remarried in 1975, with the family briefly living in\nFlorida\nbefore the couple separated the following year in 1976.\n[\n61\n]\nUpon their return to Pennsylvania, Bowers and his mother lived with his mother's parents in\nWhitehall\n, a suburb of\nPittsburgh\n. His maternal grandparents took responsibility for raising him because his mother suffered from health problems.\n[\n61\n]\nBowers attended\nBaldwin High School\nin the\nBaldwin-Whitehall School District\nfrom August 1986 to November 1989. He dropped out of high school before graduation and worked as a\ntrucker\nfor 13 years until 2002.\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\nNeighbors described Bowers as \"a ghost\" who rarely interacted with others.\n[\n58\n]\nAccording to accounts which were given by Bowers' coworkers, and analysis of his recent\nsocial media\nposts, his\nconservatism\nbecame radicalized as\nwhite nationalism\n; at one point in the late-1990s, Bowers was fascinated by the right-wing radio host\nJim Quinn\n, who at the time was on\nWRRK\n.\n[\n67\n]\nAt a later time, he became a follower of \"aggressive online provocateurs of the right wing's\nfringe\n.\"\n[\n68\n]\nHe was deeply involved in posting comments on social media websites such as\nGab\nand he also promoted\nantisemitic conspiracy theories\non them.\n[\n69\n]\nBowers routinely discussed a conspiracy theory that Jews were assisting \"evil\nMuslims\n\" to take over the United States together.\n[\n70\n]\nAt the same time, he accused\nISIS\nof being a Jewish terrorist group and said the\nIslamic State beheadings\nwere\nritual murders of Christians\n.\n[\n71\n]\nGab has been described as friendly to\nneo-Nazis\n,\nwhite supremacists\n, and the\nalt-right\n.\n[\n72\n]\nBowers registered his Gab profile in January 2018 under the handle \"onedingo\"; he described his account by the following: \"Jews are the children of\nSatan\n(\nJohn 8:44\n). The Lord\nJesus Christ\n[has] come in the flesh.\" The cover picture was a photo with the number 1488, which is used by neo-Nazis and white supremacists to evoke\nDavid Lane\n's \"\nFourteen Words\n\" and the Nazi slogan\nHeil Hitler\n. Bowers published posts that supported the\nwhite genocide conspiracy theory\n, such as one that said, \"Daily Reminder: Diversity means chasing down the last white person\".\n[\n73\n]\nBowers said that supporters of the\nQAnon\nconspiracy theory were \"deluded\" and being tricked.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\n[\n76\n]\nBowers was very active on social media, posting his own similar antisemitic and racist rants. He often re-posted content by other similarly minded users, such as Patrick Little, who expressed antisemitic, neo-Nazi, white nationalist/supremacist thoughts and\ndenied the Holocaust\n. In addition, he reposted comments in support of the four men behind the\nbeating of DeAndre Harris\nand the\nSouthern California\n-based\nalt-right\nfight club\nRise Above Movement\n(RAM) in the August 2017\nUnite the Right rally\nin\nCharlottesville, Virginia\n. RAM was later arrested by the\nFBI\nand convicted at trial for violence against counter-demonstrators. Bowers also posted comments in support of the \"Western chauvinist\"\nProud Boys\nled by\nGavin McInnes\n, who were arrested the same month for engaging in a fight with\nAntifa\noutside the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City.\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\n[\n80\n]\n[\n81\n]\n[\n82\n]\nHis posts on Gab mentioned that he was initially a supporter of US president\nDonald Trump\n.\n[\n77\n]\nBowers felt that Trump was not extreme enough, and he criticized him as \"\nglobalist\n, not a\nnationalist\n\"\n[\n83\n]\nand suggested Trump was being controlled by Jews.\n[\n84\n]\nBowers also denounced\nAfrican Americans\nwith\nracial slurs\nand images which are related to\nlynchings\n, and he also denounced\nwhite women who have relationships with Black men\n.\n[\n85\n]\nHe used his online accounts to post\nconspiracy theories\nregarding philanthropist\nGeorge Soros\n.\n[\n86\n]\nThe Times\nsaid that security sources had alleged that Bowers had links to the\nfar-right\nand neo-Nazis in the\nUnited Kingdom\n.\n[\n87\n]\nA month before the attack, Bowers posted photos of results of his target practice. He also posted a photo of his three handguns, calling them his \"glock family\".\n[\n80\n]\nIn the post, he identified the\n.357 SIG\nhandguns as\nGlock 31, Glock 32, and Glock 33\n.\n[\n79\n]\nBowers coordinated with Brad Griffin (aka Hunter Wallace) of\nOccidental Dissent\n, an alt-right associated blogger and member of\nLeague of the South\non\ndoxxing\nan unidentified\nleft-wing\nblogger. Bowers wrote \"that address is not the most current for him. I can get you the most recent outside of gab\".\n[\n88\n]\nLeague of the South was one of the organizations that participated in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville.\n[\n88\n]\nIn the weeks before the shooting, Bowers made antisemitic posts directed at the\nHIAS\n-sponsored\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nNational Refugee Shabbat\n[\n89\n]\nof October 19–20, in which Dor Hadash\n[\n13\n]\nparticipated. He claimed Jews were aiding members of\nCentral American caravans\nmoving toward the United States border and referred to those migrants as \"invaders\".\n[\n10\n]\nShortly before the attack, he posted on Gab that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\"\n[\n51\n]\n[\n90\n]\n[\n60\n]\nAccording to the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center\n, \"the mention of '\noptics\n' references a disagreement that has raged within the\nwhite nationalist\nmovement since the Unite the Right rally in 2017 about how best to get their message across to the general public\".\n[\n91\n]\nAfter the shooting, Gab suspended Bowers's profile and pledged to cooperate with the criminal investigation.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n82\n]\nShortly after the attack,\nPayPal\n,\nStripe\n,\nJoyent\n, and\nMedium\npulled their support for Gab, and\nGoDaddy\n, under which the Gab domains were registered, required Gab to relocate their domain name hosting to a different service, effectively shutting Gab down in the short term.\n[\n92\n]\nCriminal charges and proceedings\n[\nedit\n]\nFederal criminal proceedings\n[\nedit\n]\nIndictment and pretrial proceedings\n[\nedit\n]\nBowers was charged by the\nU.S. Department of Justice\nwith 29\nfederal crimes\n.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n93\n]\nBowers appeared in\nfederal court in Pittsburgh\non October 29, 2018, and was ordered\nheld without bail\npending trial.\n[\n94\n]\nTwo days later, Bowers was\nindicted\non 44 counts by a\nfederal grand jury\n. The charges carry a maximum\npenalty of death\nor 535 years in federal prison.\n[\n95\n]\nThe counts included\nhate crimes\n,\n[\n96\n]\n11 counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence, four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer, and three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence.\n[\n35\n]\n[\n93\n]\n[\n97\n]\n[\n98\n]\nOn November 1, 2018, Bowers entered a plea of not guilty.\n[\n99\n]\nOn January 29, 2019, the grand jury indicted Bowers on an additional 19 counts, 13 of which were for hate crimes.\n[\n100\n]\nOn February 11, 2019, Bowers was\narraigned\nin federal court.\n[\n9\n]\nBowers's defense team includes two public defenders plus well-known\ncriminal defense attorney\nJudy Clarke\n, a death penalty expert who was appointed by the court as co-counsel for the defendant.\n[\n9\n]\n[\n101\n]\nThe defense offered a plea deal in which Bowers would plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of\nlife imprisonment without parole\n; federal prosecutors declined, seeking the\ndeath penalty\ninstead.\n[\n101\n]\n[\n102\n]\n[\n103\n]\nThe trial date was not set until various pretrial motions were resolved.\n[\n103\n]\n[\n104\n]\nIn April 2020, Senior U.S. District Judge\nDonetta Ambrose\ndenied a defense challenge to the federal death penalty.\n[\n101\n]\nIn October 2020, Judge Ambrose denied a defense motion to dismiss charges brought under the\nHate Crimes Prevention Act\nand\nChurch Arson Prevention Act\n.\n[\n101\n]\nIn November 2021, the defense decided that it would not pursue an\ninsanity defense\nor intellectual disability defense.\n[\n105\n]\nIn January 2022, after holding an earlier evidentiary hearing, Judge Ambrose denied Bowers's\nmotion to suppress\nevidence of statements he made after being arrested by police, inside an ambulance, and at the hospital the day of the attack.\n[\n106\n]\nAfter Judge Ambrose retired in February 2022, the case was randomly reassigned to U.S. District Judge\nRobert J. Colville\n.\n[\n107\n]\nIn March 2022, Colville denied Bowers's motion for a\nchange of venue\n.\n[\n108\n]\nTrial\n[\nedit\n]\nIn September 2022, Judge Colville set the trial to begin in April 2023, rejecting a bid by the defense to delay the trial until December 2023.\n[\n109\n]\nIn March 2023, members of the\njury pool\nbegan completing questionnaires.\n[\n110\n]\nThe\njury selection\nprocess began on April 24 with twelve jurors and six alternates being selected.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nThe trial began May 30, 2023.\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nProsecutors called sixty witnesses, while the defense did not call any witnesses.\n[\n115\n]\nThe witnesses who testified included survivors of the attack, including congregants and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers.\n[\n115\n]\nEvidence presented to the jury included recordings of\n9-1-1\ncalls as the attacks unfolded (including from some of the people killed), and testimony from police officers who ultimately subdued the gunman; from expert witnesses on medicine, guns, and computers; from the FBI agents and police detectives who investigated the case; from a paramedic who responded to the scene; and from the director of the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office.\n[\n115\n]\n[\n116\n]\nPhotographs were also introduced as evidence,\n[\n115\n]\nincluding photos of exhaustively documented bloodstains, bullet fragments, and\nshell casings\n, and\npolice body-worn camera\nfootage was also shown to the jury.\n[\n116\n]\nBowers's antisemitic social media posts were also introduced as evidence.\n[\n117\n]\nAfter 11 days of testimony, prosecutors told the jury in\nclosing argument\nthat Bowers had made \"cold, calculated, deliberate choices\" in the shooting.\n[\n117\n]\nBowers's defense counsel conceded that he had fatally shot all the victims, but argued that there was doubt as to his specific intent: \"why he did what he did and what he thought he would accomplish by doing so.\"\n[\n117\n]\nOn June 16, 2023, 50-year-old Bowers was found guilty on all 63 federal charges, including 11 counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death; the jury rendered its verdict after five hours of deliberation over two days.\n[\n118\n]\nSentencing phase\n[\nedit\n]\nThe sentencing phase began on June 16, 2023, with the jury hearing arguments to decide if Bowers should be\nsentenced to death\nor life without parole. Bowers' defense lawyers sought to persuade the jury that Bowers had significant brain damage\n[\n119\n]\nand was influenced by mental illness or delusions.\n[\n120\n]\n[\n121\n]\nBy contrast, prosecutors emphasized evidence showing that Bowers had extensively planned his attack and was motivated by antisemitism,\n[\n119\n]\n[\n120\n]\nas shown in his numerous rants on social media and statements to police after the attack.\n[\n121\n]\nThree\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\nphysicians (two radiologists and a neurologist) testified about their review of brain-imaging tests (an\nEEG\n,\nPET\n, and\nMRI\n) of Bowers in 2021 and 2022.\n[\n119\n]\nThey found the tests to be largely normal.\n[\n119\n]\n[\n121\n]\nTwo defense experts, by contrast, testified that they believed Bowers \"had significant brain damage that could be correlated with\nschizophrenia\n\" and could affect behavior.\n[\n119\n]\nA separate defense expert, a\nUniversity of North Texas\nforensic psychologist\n, testified on his opinions from 20 hours of examination of Bowers over four days in 2022. He testified that Bowers was \"proud\" of his attack, showed no remorse for the shooting, and thought that he deserved medals and a parade.\n[\n120\n]\nThe psychologist opined that Bowers is \"blatantly psychotic\" and suffers from schizophrenia, but agreed on cross-examination that he was \"goal-oriented\" and planned the attack as much as six months in advance.\n[\n120\n]\nSeparately, a\nneurologist\nwho examined Bowers in 2021 testified as a defense expert, opining that Bowers had schizophrenia and\nepilepsy\n.\n[\n121\n]\nOn cross-examination, the defense neurologist acknowledged that Bowers was not \"incapable\" of plotting the shootings, but testified that \"his reasons for planning it out are unreliable in his brain.\"\n[\n121\n]\nThe defense presented evidence of Bowers's lengthy history of\nserious mental illness\n, including multiple suicide attempts since his teenage years, an incident in which he \"threw flammable liquid on his mother and tried to ignite it\" at age thirteen, and three instances of\ninvoluntary commitment\n, the latest in 2004.\n[\n121\n]\nAt the request of the defense, the sentencing phase was split into two parts (each with its own opening statements, closing arguments and jury decision): (1) whether Bowers was eligible to be sentenced to death and (2) the selection of the sentence. On July 13, 2023, after two hours of deliberation, the jury found that Bowers was eligible for a death sentence.\n[\n122\n]\nAfter making further deliberation on sentence for two days, the federal jury issued a unanimous decision to sentence Bowers to the death penalty on August 2.\n[\n123\n]\nBowers was the first and only criminal to be\nsentenced to death by the US federal government\nduring the presidency of\nJoe Biden\n.\n[\n124\n]\n[\n125\n]\nOn August 3, 2023, Bowers was formally sentenced to death.\n[\n126\n]\nImprisonment\n[\nedit\n]\nOn August 26, 2023, Bowers was transferred to the custody of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nand placed on\ndeath row\nat\nUnited States Penitentiary, Terre Haute\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBowers attempted to appeal his sentence for a new trial in November 2023,\n[\n128\n]\nbut his request was denied in May 2024.\n[\n129\n]\nIn December 2024, when President\nJoe Biden\nannounced\ncommutations for the death sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates\nto life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, he excluded Bowers along with\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev\n, who perpetrated the 2013\nBoston Marathon bombing\n, and\nDylann Roof\n, who committed the 2015\nCharleston church shooting\n, because of their convictions for either terrorism or hate-motivated mass murder related crimes.\n[\n130\n]\nState criminal proceedings\n[\nedit\n]\nBowers was also charged with 36\nstate criminal counts\n, including 11 counts of\ncriminal homicide\n, six counts of\naggravated assault\n, six counts of attempted criminal homicide, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.\n[\n36\n]\nThe state charges were held in\nabeyance\npending the federal trial.\n[\n96\n]\nReactions\n[\nedit\n]\nUnited States\n[\nedit\n]\nNational\n[\nedit\n]\nPennsylvania Governor\nTom Wolf\nmakes a statement about the shooting. Pittsburgh Mayor\nBill Peduto\nstands listening in the striped tie.\nPresident\nDonald Trump\n, Pennsylvania Governor\nTom Wolf\n,\nthen-Braddock\nMayor\nJohn Fetterman\n, and\nPittsburgh City Councilman\nCorey O'Connor\nreleased statements about the incident through\nTwitter\n. Trump called the shooting a wicked,\nantisemitic\nact of \"pure evil.\"\n[\n55\n]\nHe also opined that the shooting was preventable: \"If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop him\".\n[\n131\n]\n[\n132\n]\n[\n133\n]\nTrump suggested cases such as this call for the\ndeath penalty\n.\n[\n133\n]\nCecilia Wang of the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\nsaid the attack, along with other recent unrest, was inspired by elements of Trump's rhetoric.\n[\n134\n]\nVice President\nMike Pence\ndenied any such connection in an\nNBC News\ninterview that night.\n[\n135\n]\n[\n136\n]\nOver 2,000 people, including many from the local Jewish community, protested against Trump's visit to the synagogue site, chanting \"words have meaning\", and carrying signs with such slogans as \"We build bridges,\nnot walls\n\".\n[\n137\n]\nFrom October 27 to 31, all\nU.S. flags\non public and military grounds were flown at\nhalf-staff\nin memory of the victims.\n[\n138\n]\nOn the Friday following the shooting,\nDavid Shribman\n, executive editor of the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n, ran the opening of the\nHebrew\n-\nAramaic\nkaddish\n, often called the\nJewish mourner's prayer\n, as a full-width front-page headline.\n[\n139\n]\nJewish security\n[\nedit\n]\nThe aftermath of the shooting included arguably the most ambitious and comprehensive effort ever taken to protect Jewish life in the United States, according to the\nNew York Times\n. In addition to bringing in $100 million in federal grants through the\nNonprofit Security Grant Program\n(NGSP), the\nJewish Federations of North America\nraised $62 million to secure every Jewish community in North America, overseen by the\nSecure Community Network\n. By 2023, 93\nJewish federations\nhad full-time security directors, a more than four-fold increase over the previous 5 years.\n[\n140\n]\nThe next year, the\nPennsylvania General Assembly\npassed Act 83 of 2019 to establish the state's Nonprofit Security Grant Fund, a state-level version of the NGSP. Initially, $5 million in grant funding was available. After an increase in antisemitism during the\nGaza war\nin 2023, the General Assembly increased the available funding to $10 million.\n[\n141\n]\nIn the 5 years since its inception, the fund distributed $25 million to synagogues, mosques, and other nonprofit organizations.\n[\n142\n]\nLocal\n[\nedit\n]\nCarnegie Mellon University lowered the American flag to\nhalf-staff\nto mourn the victims.\nPeople gathered again at the intersection of Forbes and Murray Avenues in front of the\nSixth Presbyterian Church\non October 30. On the same day, Trump visited Pittsburgh in response to the shooting incident.\n[\n143\n]\nImmediately after the shooting, the campus of\nCarnegie Mellon University\nwas placed on lockdown and all university-sponsored activities were cancelled for the day.\n[\n24\n]\nAt the same time residents were advised by police to remain in their homes and stay off the streets.\n[\n53\n]\nAn unusually large proportion of the Pittsburgh Jewish community from all denominations participated in local\nJewish rituals related to death and mourning\n. Jewish tradition requires a person to guard a corpse until it is buried.\nShomrim\n(volunteer guards) took one-hour shifts at the Pittsburgh morgue until the bodies were moved to funeral homes.\nThe Atlantic\nreported that \"most of the volunteers appeared to be Orthodox, but they felt strong solidarity with the liberal communities that were directly affected by the shooting.\"\n[\n144\n]\nMembers of the\nPittsburgh Steelers\nattended the joint funeral service for the Rosenthal brothers on Tuesday, October 30, when\nNFL\nteams are traditionally off. The brothers, who were\nintellectually disabled\n, had a sister who is a former employee of the team.\n[\n145\n]\nDuring the long wait for a trial, members of the Pittsburgh congregations received interfaith support and solidarity from\nblack church\nand\nAmerican Sikh\ncommunities targeted by violent hatred,\n[\n146\n]\nincluding members of the\nEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church\nin\nCharleston, South Carolina\n(targeted by a\nshooting attack in 2015\n)\n[\n146\n]\nand the\nSikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin\nthat had been targeted in a shooting attack in 2012.\n[\n147\n]\nInternational\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nEiffel Tower\nin Paris darkened its lights in tribute to the victims of the shooting.\n[\n148\n]\nIsrael's Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu\ncondemned the \"horrifying antisemitic brutality\", adding \"the whole of Israel grieves with the families of the dead.\"\n[\n149\n]\nIsrael's education and\ndiaspora affairs minister\n,\nNaftali Bennett\n, immediately left for Pittsburgh to visit the synagogue, meet with community members, and participate in the funerals of the victims,\n[\n150\n]\nand directed the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs \"to assess and prepare to assist the Pittsburgh Jewish community, 'including the need for emergency and resilience teams that immediately left Israel for psychological assistance and community rehabilitation.'\"\n[\n151\n]\n[\n152\n]\n[\n153\n]\nIsrael's cabinet\nstood for a moment's silence on October 28 to honor the victims.\n[\n154\n]\nAshkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel\nDavid Lau\nsaid \"any murder of any Jew in any part of the world for being Jewish is unforgivable\".\n[\n155\n]\nHe described the location as \"a place with a profound Jewish flavor\". Many news reports said he refused to refer to the Conservative congregation as a \"synagogue\" since it is non-Orthodox.\n[\n156\n]\nProminent non-Orthodox Israeli religious leaders and scholars rejected his statement.\n[\n157\n]\n[\n158\n]\n[\n159\n]\nTel Aviv Municipality\nlit the city hall building with the colors of the American flag in solidarity with the victims of the Pittsburgh attack.\n[\n160\n]\n[\n161\n]\nAn image of the Israeli flag next to the American flag was projected onto Jerusalem's\nWestern Wall\n.\n[\n162\n]\nPope Francis\ndenounced the \"inhuman act of violence\" in his Sunday prayers in\nSt. Peter's Square\non October 28, and led prayers for the dead and wounded, as well as their families. He asked God \"to help us to extinguish the flames of hatred that develop in our societies\".\n[\n163\n]\nIranian Minister of Foreign Affairs\nJavad Zarif\noffered his\nthoughts and prayers\nto the victims of the shooting, and said \"Extremism and terrorism know no race or religion, and must be condemned in all cases\".\n[\n164\n]\nHamas\noffered condolences and condemned the attack, noting that they could relate as being \"victims of Israeli terror\". Hamas had previously expressed support for shootings at synagogues in Israel.\n[\n165\n]\n[\n166\n]\nJan Kickert\n,\nAustrian\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations\n, said: \"The attack ... was an attack on all of us, on what we stand for – religious liberty, human rights. We are committed to the safety and security of Jews wherever they are. I say this with growing up and living with the shame that my forefathers were among the worst perpetrators in Nazi times.\"\n[\n167\n]\nMedia and organizations\n[\nedit\n]\nMany local businesses on Murray Avenue put up posters in support of the victims.\nThe New York Times\npublished an op-ed by\nJonathan Greenblatt\n, CEO of the\nAnti-Defamation League\n, that urged readers to fight against antisemitism and hate.\n[\n168\n]\nA CNN editorial described the shooting as one of three hate-incited acts that took place in the United States in the same week, along with\na series of mail bombing attempts\nand\na shooting at a Kroger grocery store\nin\nJeffersontown, Kentucky\n.\n[\n169\n]\nOn October 28, the\nEmpire State Building\ndarkened its lights in honor of the victims. According to the building's Twitter account, the top of the spire was left aglow with \"an orange halo shining a light on gun violence awareness\".\n[\n170\n]\nIn the wake of the shooting, the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\ndarkened its traditional Victory Lights atop of the\nCathedral of Learning\n,\n[\n171\n]\nand on November 2, the university altered the Victory Lights so the blue beam would shine for 11 seconds, one second for each fatality.\n[\n172\n]\nSports\n[\nedit\n]\nSports teams that observed a moment of silence for the shooting victims included the\nPittsburgh Steelers\nat their home game against the\nCleveland Browns\n,\n[\n173\n]\nthe\nNew Orleans Saints\nat the\nMinnesota Vikings\n,\n[\n174\n]\nthe\nPittsburgh Penguins\nat the\nVancouver Canucks\n,\n[\n175\n]\nthe\nWinnipeg Jets\nat the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n,\n[\n176\n]\nthe\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nand the\nJacksonville Jaguars\nplaying in\nLondon\n,\n[\n177\n]\nand the\nPittsburgh Panthers\nhosting\nDuke\nat\nHeinz Field\n.\n[\n178\n]\nA moment of silence was also observed before Game 4 of the\nWorld Series\nat\nDodger Stadium\non the night of October 27.\n[\n178\n]\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins wore jerseys with a patch that read \"Stronger Than Hate\" for their game against the\nNew York Islanders\non October 30.

They went to the synagogue, where they met with Tree of Life spiritual leader Jeffrey Myers and Israeli ambassador to the US\nRon Dermer\n. Trump lit candles for the victims inside and outside placed stones on each of the 11 Star-of-David markers of the memorial. The group went to\nUPMC Presbyterian Hospital\n, where Trump spoke with wounded victims, their families, law enforcement officials, and medical staff.\n[\n143\n]\nTrump's visit was discouraged by some in the Pittsburgh community. Pittsburgh mayor\nBill Peduto\nsaid Trump should not have come, as the wounds were raw and the community was just beginning to mourn and hold funerals.\n[\n205\n]\nPeduto, with agreement from\nAllegheny County\nexecutive\nRich Fitzgerald\n, also urged Trump to consider \"the wills of the families\" of the deceased.\n[\n206\n]\nMore than 70,000 people had signed an open letter written by Bend the Arc: Pittsburgh saying that Trump was not welcome until he \"fully denounces white nationalism\".\n[\n207\n]\nOne of the survivors, Dan Leger, refused to meet Trump in the hospital and later wrote a critical op-ed for the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n.\n[\n208\n]\nFormer Tree of Life president Lynette Lederman opposed Trump's visit, saying she felt his words were \"hypocritical\" and that \"We have people who stand by us who believe in values, not just Jewish values, but believe in values, and those are not the values of this president, and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\".\n[\n209\n]\n[\n210\n]\n[\n211\n]\nBefore Trump's visit, Tree of Life rabbi Jeffrey Myers said,\n\"There is hate, and it isn't going away. It just seems to be getting worse. ... We've got to stop hate, and it can't just be to say we need to stop hate. We need to do, we need to act to tone down rhetoric,\" adding that he would welcome a visit from Trump.\n[\n209\n]\nAaron Bisno, the rabbi of\nRodef Shalom Congregation\n, said he did not think Trump's presence was beneficial, saying that Trump had become a \"symbol of division\" for many.\n[\n212\n]\nDuring Trump's visit to the synagogue, an estimated 2,000 protesters were cordoned off a few blocks away.\n[\n213\n]\nAfterward, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, \"The President was very warm, very consoling.\"\n[\n214\n]\nNeo-Nazis and white supremacists\n[\nedit\n]\nAmong American\nneo-Nazis\nand\nwhite supremacists\n, figures such as\nRichard B.
