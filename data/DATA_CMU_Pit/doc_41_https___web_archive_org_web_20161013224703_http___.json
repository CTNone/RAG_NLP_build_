Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the\nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to\nfraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the\nentity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also\nincludes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant\naccounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our\naudit opinion.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the University of Pittsburgh – Of the Commonwealth System of Higher\nEducation as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years\nthen ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nSeptember 22, 2016\nKPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership,\nthe U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative\n(“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nJUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015\n(in thousands of dollars)\n2016 2015\nASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents (Notes 1 and 5) $ 6,400 $ 49,582\nOperating investments (Notes 4 and 5) 558,801 569,806\nInventories and deferred charges 20,984 20,546\nAccounts and notes receivable, net (Note 2) 188,277 143,498\nContributions receivable, net (Note 3) 31,935 34,545\nStudent loans receivable, net 47,611 45,852\nDeposits of bond proceeds (Notes 1 and 5) 6,598 19,291\nFoundation assets (Note 1) 26,351 26,419\nEndowment investments (Notes 4 and 5) 3,546,458 3,610,395\nEndowed funds held by third parties (Note 5) 22,079 23,140\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net (Note 6) 1,774,065 1,785,749\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 6,229,559 $ 6,328,823\nLIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 95,212 $ 98,125\nAccrued payroll and related liabilities 74,796 72,507\nDeferred student and other revenue 50,801 45,252\nAdvanced receipt of grant funds 62,689 60,596\nRefundable U.S. government student loans 33,897 33,647\nOther liabilities (Notes 5 and 8) 148,811 116,071\nPension and postretirement obligations (Note 9) 589,385 479,334\nConditional asset remediation obligation (Note 6) 37,346 41,219\nBonds and notes payable (Note 7) 948,949 981,632\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 2,041,886 1,928,383\nNET ASSETS:\nUnrestricted (Notes 1 and 10) 2,764,269 2,911,882\nTemporarily restricted (Notes 1 and 10) 714,738 804,388\nPermanently restricted (Notes 1 and 10) 708,666 684,170\nTOTAL NET ASSETS 4,187,673 4,400,440\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND NET ASSETS $ 6,229,559 $ 6,328,823\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n1CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016\nCOMPARED TO SUMMARY INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015\n(in thousands of dollars)\n2016\nTemporarily Permanently\nOPERATING REVENUES: Unrestricted Restricted Restricted Total 2015\nTuition and fees $ 764,499 $ -
