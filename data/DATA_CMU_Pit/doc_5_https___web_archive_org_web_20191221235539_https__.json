Brookner\nJanet Krasner Aronson\nLeonard Saxe2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nVersion 1.1\nRevised March 20, 2018\n© 2018 Brandeis University\nSteinhardt Social Research Institute\nwww.brandeis.edu/ssri\nEstablished in 2005 and housed at the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, the Steinhardt Social\nResearch Institute (SSRI) uses innovative research methods to collect and analyze sociodemographic\ndata on the Jewish community.\nThe Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies (CMJS), founded in 1980, is dedicated to providing\nindependent, high-quality research on issues related to contemporary Jewish life.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nJewish Federation Acknowledgments\nThe Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh has taken the lead for the past decade on measuring\nour community’s progress by developing the Community Scorecard. This 2017 Pittsburgh Jewish\nCommunity Study is the next step in a continuous process to provide real facts for the Jewish\nFederation, Jewish organizations, synagogues, and interested individuals to make informed\ndecisions based on data. But now the real work begins: to leverage the strengths that make our\ncommunity top-notch and to seize opportunities that address areas for improvement.\nWe are grateful to many people who helped bring this study to fruition. Our thanks to the Jewish\nCommunity Foundation of the Jewish Federation, that funded this project in its entirety, the first\nof its kind in more than 15 years. Our thanks as well go to the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish\nStudies and Steinhardt Social Research Institute at Brandeis University for shepherding the\nresearch, patiently answering our questions and bringing their expertise to our work. Most of all,\nthanks to our volunteers and to you, the Jewish community, for participating and for supporting\nthis project.\nThere are many questions that come from what we learn in these pages. For example, how will we\ncontinue to foster Jewish education with a changed population of school-age Jewish children? How\nwill we welcome interfaith families and those who identify as “just Jewish”? What will be our\napproach to synagogues as the number of Jews belonging to synagogues has declined? Where,\nthroughout the greater Jewish Pittsburgh community, are the gaps in services?\nTake your time to familiarize yourself with these numbers. Ask questions. Start conversations. The\nfull report can be found at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh's website, www.jfedpgh.org.\nBring your own experience and understanding to the study. But be open to new and surprising\nfacts. Please join us as we strive to become the BEST Jewish community of 49,200 possible. To do\nso, your participation is invaluable.\nEvan Indianer, Chair, Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nMeryl K.

The study was proposed and sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh,\nwhose staff, Board of Directors, and community study committee provided valuable input on the\nstudy design, questionnaire, and report. We are particularly grateful to Community Scorecard\nDirector Raimy Rubin, Committee Chair Evan Indianer, and Cindy Shapira, Chair of the\nFederation Board of Directors when the study began, who helped us learn about the community\nand ensured that our work would be of the highest quality and utility for the Pittsburgh Jewish\ncommunity. We appreciate the generosity of the organizations that shared contact information with\nus for the purposes of this study. Finally, we thank the 2,111 respondents who completed the\nsurvey. Without their willingness to spend time answering numerous questions about their lives,\nthere could be no study.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the staff of Abt Associates, who served as the call center for this\nstudy. We were pleased to work with Benjamin Phillips, our former colleague at CMJS/SSRI, who\ndirected the project at Abt Associates, assisted by Valrie Horton. Dennis Daly oversaw\nadministration of the data collection operation.\nThis project could not have been conducted without the assistance of a large group of our\ncolleagues and students at the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies and Steinhardt Social\nResearch Institute. We deeply appreciate their efforts. Elizabeth Tighe, Daniel Parmer, and Raquel\nMagidin led the efforts of the American Jewish Population Project team to develop the population\nestimates for this study. Matthew Feinberg ably managed the process of combining lists and\ndeduplicating them. Camille Evans, Lev Paasche-Orlow, and Tamar Shachaf Schneider helped\nprepare mailings for the primary sample and cleaned data. Camille Evans, Yaoyao Gao, Jeff Hart,\nLeora Kagedan, Eve Litvak, Lev Paasche-Orlow, Tamar Shachaf Schneider, Joanna Spyra, and Gal\nZahori spent countless hours searching for missing contact information for members of the\nsample. Breanna Vizlakh prepared a Russian-language version of the survey, which Sofiya\nNuryyeva used to complete several interviews with respondents over the phone. Jeff Hart, Tamar\nShachaf Schneider, Joanna Spyra, and Gal Zahori coded responses to open-ended questions in the\nsurvey. Jeff also developed Stata code to simplify the compiling of the Codebook and Comparison\nCharts. Naomi Weinblatt helped to prepare tables for the report. Deborah Grant provided editorial\nadvice and feedback, and she and Masha Lokshin organized the report for its final layout. Masha\nLokshin and Ilana Friedman provided logistical support throughout the study.\nSpecial thanks go to Sarah Harpaz, whose dedication to our work is deeply appreciated. Sarah\nmanaged the logistics of the study from Brandeis, liaising with the call center; fielding questions,\nconcerns, compliments, and complaints from members of the sample; helping with reminders;\nassisting in the development and testing of the questionnaire; building the maps; and participating\nin countless other tasks necessary to the proper conduct of the study.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study i\nTable of Contents\nList of Figures and Tables ................................................................................................................. iv\nExecutive Summary ............................................................................................................................. 1\nChapter 1.

Greater Pittsburgh’s Jews constitute a little over 2% of the area\npopulation. The Jewish community has grown 17% since its last community study in 2002.\nThe composition of the Jewish community has changed since 2002. The largest shares of the\npopulation are adults ages 18-29 and 60-69. Because there are fewer adults in their 30s and 40s than\nthere were in 2002, there are also fewer children. However, nearly 40% of Jewish children in the\ncommunity are ages 0-5. Newcomers to the community are also replacing those who move away.\nBoth developments signal that the growth of the community is likely to continue.\nThe community is spreading out geographically. Younger adults and families are more\nprevalent in the city, and older adults reside in greater numbers in the suburbs and outlying areas.\nThe Pittsburgh Jewish community is highly educated. Pittsburgh-area Jewish adults have even\nhigher levels of educational attainment than the US Jewish community as a whole, with 84% of\nlocal Jewish adults having at least a college degree compared with 58% of all US Jewish adults.\nThe Pittsburgh Jewish community is mostly middle class. One-third (33%) of Pittsburgh-area\nJews describe themselves as prosperous (7%) or living very comfortably (26%), and another 45%\nsay they are living reasonably comfortably. Fifteen percent say they are just getting along, and 8%\nsay they are nearly poor or poor.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, as defined by the Federation catchment area, includes\nall of Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties. The present report\ncompares Squirrel Hill, the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, the South Hills, the North Hills, and the\nrest of the region. Squirrel Hill has historically been the center of Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh\nand remains home to 26% of all Pittsburgh-area Jewish households. Another 31% of Jewish\nhouseholds are in the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, primarily in neighborhoods surrounding\nSquirrel Hill. The South Hills area is now home to 20% of all Jewish households, and 9% reside in\nthe North Hills. The remaining 14% of Jewish households are distributed through the rest of the\nfive-county area.2 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nChildren\nOverall, 76% of children in Jewish households are being raised Jewish in some way.\nSeventy-one percent are being raised exclusively Jewish, either by religion (56%) or culturally\n(15%).\nAmong children with intermarried parents, 33% are being raised exclusively Jewish, either\nby religion or culturally. Another 11% are being raised both Jewish and in another religion. Fifty-\none percent are being raised in no religion or with no decision yet made about how to raise the\nchildren. Six percent are being raised in a religion other than Judaism. (The total adds up to more\nthan 100% due to rounding.) The proportion of children raised Jewish by intermarried parents is\nlower than the national average.\nOverall, 52% of Jewish children in grades K-12 participated in at least one Jewish\neducational program in the past year. Forty-five percent of Jewish children in grades K-12 are\nenrolled in Jewish part-time school, day school, or a Jewish tutoring program, and 41% participated\nin a Jewish youth group or attended a Jewish day camp or overnight camp. Twenty-eight percent of\npreschool-aged Jewish children are enrolled in a Jewish preschool.\nJewish Engagement and Synagogue Membership\nJewish behavior includes family and home-based practices, ritual practices, personal activities, and\norganizational participation. Examining an index that combines multiple measures of Jewish life,\nmembers of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community can be thought of as displaying five patterns\nof Jewish engagement. These groupings provide a deeper way of understanding Jewish engagement\naside from denominational affiliation and ritual behavior.\nPittsburgh-area Jews display similar patterns of denominational affiliation as the overall US\nJewish population. Thirty-four percent of Jewish adults identify as Reform, more than any other\ndenomination. Thirty percent say they have no specific denomination.\nIn the Greater Pittsburgh area, 35% of households belong to a synagogue or another Jewish\nworship community of some type. These households include 38% of Jewish adults, similar to\nthe national average (39%). The proportion of member households has declined since 2002 (53%).\nThe largest group of synagogue members (19% of households) are dues-paying members\nof local “brick-and-mortar” synagogues. The remaining synagogue members (16% of\nhouseholds) belong to independent minyanim or chavurot, Chabad, or non-local congregations, or\nconsider themselves members of brick-and-mortar synagogues but do not pay dues.\nCommunity\nJewish community ties are important to Pittsburgh-area Jews. Eighty percent of Jewish adults\nsay that being Jewish is somewhat or very much a matter of community. About two-thirds (63%)\nsay it is important to feel connected to the Jewish community in Pittsburgh, and 43% feel2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 3\nsomewhat or very connected to the local Jewish community. Two-thirds (65%) feel very connected\nto the global Jewish community.\nNearly one-third (30%) of Pittsburgh-area Jewish households say they are members of the\nJCC. This includes 20% who say they pay dues, and 10% who consider themselves members but\ndo not pay dues. Membership rates are highest in Squirrel Hill (40%), the South Hills (29%),\nand the rest of the city of Pittsburgh (25%).\nNearly one-third (32%) say they are members of another Jewish organization besides a\nsynagogue or the JCC. Half of senior citizens belong to a Jewish organization other than a\nsynagogue or the JCC.\nThirty-nine percent of Jewish adults engaged in some volunteer activity in the past month,\neither with a Jewish organization or with a non-Jewish organization. Eighteen percent volunteered\nwith a Jewish organization in any capacity, including 15% who have taken on leadership roles such\nas serving on a board or committee. Twenty-eight percent volunteered for non-Jewish\norganizations, including 8% who also volunteered for Jewish organizations.\nNinety-three percent of Jewish adults made charitable donations in the past year. Seventy-\nsix percent donated to at least one Jewish organization; 63% donated to a Jewish organization that\nserves the Pittsburgh-area Jewish community. The causes volunteers and donors deem most\nimportant are education (83% “very important”), health/medical causes (79%), social justice (73%),\nand women’s rights (72%).\nIsrael\nApproximately three-fifths (59%) of Pittsburgh-area Jewish adults have visited Israel or\nlived there. One-quarter (24%) have visited once. Another quarter (28%) have visited multiple\ntimes, and 7% lived there at some point, including 3% who are Israeli citizens. The proportion of\nPittsburgh-area Jewish adults who have visited Israel has increased since 2002 (44%).\nApproximately one-third (33%) of Pittsburgh-area Jewish adults feel very connected to\nIsrael. By contrast, 17% feel not at all connected to Israel.\nHealth and Well-Being\nThe majority of Pittsburgh-area Jewish households are financially comfortable. One-third\n(33%) describe themselves as being prosperous (7%) or very comfortable (26%), and another 45%\nsay they are living reasonably comfortably. There are some households who are struggling and say\nthey are just getting by (15%) or are nearly poor or poor (8%).\nEconomic insecurity is a concern for some households. One-quarter (25%) of Jewish\nhouseholds lack sufficient savings to cover three months of expenses, and 13% say they could not\ncover an emergency $400 expense with cash, money currently in a bank account, or on a credit card\nthey could pay in full. Thirteen percent skipped at least one rent, mortgage, or utility payment in4 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nthe past year due to financial hardship. Four percent of households say that financial constraints\nhave prevented them from participating in Jewish life in some way in the Pittsburgh area in the past\nyear.\nOne-quarter (25%) of Jewish households include at least one person with a chronic health\nissue or disability. This number includes those who are limited in the amount of work, school, or\nhousework they can do as a result of an impairment, disability, or chronic physical or mental health\nissue. Eight percent of households indicate that health issues have constrained them from\nparticipating in Jewish life in some way in the Pittsburgh area in the past year.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 5\nChapter 1. Introduction\nThe goals of the 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study were to understand the size\nand character of the local Jewish population and to provide the community with high-quality data\nto drive decision-making for policy and planning. Multiple methods were used to generate\npopulation estimates of the Jewish community and to assess the attitudes and behaviors of those\nwho identify as Jewish. The central component of the study was a survey that asked a broad set of\nquestions about Jewish identity, attitudes, and engagement with the community. The survey was\nadministered both as a telephone interview and as an online instrument.\nThe study was designed to help the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community and its communal\nagencies learn about the size and demographic characteristics of their community, synagogue and\nother affiliations, interest in and utilization of programs and services, and ways that Pittsburgh Jews\nrelate to one another. The findings are intended to inform communal planning and resource\nallocation.\nAbout This Study\nThis study follows an enduring tradition of efforts to describe and understand the Greater\nPittsburgh Jewish community. Earlier demographic studies were conducted in 1938, 1963, 1984,\nand 2002 (reports are held at the Berman Jewish Databank). Since 2014, the Pittsburgh Jewish\nCommunity Scorecard has tracked key metrics in Jewish engagement, affiliation, social services and\nphilanthropy, connection to the surrounding community, and capacity building. All communities\nchange considerably over time and these studies have provided essential data for planning\npurposes. The 2017 study, initiated and funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh\n(Federation), established the following goals:\n To estimate the size and geographic distribution of the Jewish population\n To develop a portrait of the socio-demographic characteristics, affiliations, attitudes,\nbehaviors, needs, and interests of the Jewish community as a whole and of subgroups\nwithin the community\n To identify emerging needs and changes in the community over time\n To help the community make data-driven decisions for communal planning\nThe study was conducted by researchers from the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies/\nSteinhardt Social Research Institute (CMJS/SSRI) at Brandeis University. Informed by previous\nresearch and in consultation with Federation, its community study technical committee, and\nrepresentatives of Jewish organizations in the Greater Pittsburgh area, CMJS/SSRI developed a\nresearch strategy and survey instrument to address the community’s needs.6 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nMethodology\nCommunity studies rely upon scientific methods to collect information from selected members of\nthe community and, from those responses, extrapolate a generalized portrait of the community as a\nwhole. Over time, it has become increasingly complicated to conduct such studies, and particularly\nto obtain an unbiased, representative sample of community members. The 2017 Greater Pittsburgh\nJewish Community Study used innovative methods developed by CMJS/SSRI1 to overcome these\nchallenges.\nThe central obstacle is that Jews are a relatively small group and traditional methods for identifying\na representative sample of Jews are no longer feasible. The classic methodology, random-digit\ndialing (RDD), relies on telephone calls to randomly selected households in a specified geographic\narea and phone interviews with household members. Changes in telephone technology (e.g., caller\nID) and fewer people answering the phone for unknown callers have reduced response rates for\nsuch surveys below 10%.2 An even greater challenge is that over half of all households no longer\nhave landline telephones and rely exclusively on cell phones.3 Because of phone number\nportability,4 cell phones frequently have an area code, exchange, and billing address that are not\nassociated with the geographic location in which the user resides. In Jewish community studies,\nthis has proven to be especially problematic for ensuring that the survey reaches young adults and\nnewcomers to the community. It is no longer possible to select a range of phone numbers and\nassume the owners of those numbers will live in the specified area and be willing to answer the\nphone and complete a survey.\nThis study addresses these challenges by using several methods, described in detail in Appendix A:\n Enhanced RDD. The enhanced RDD method synthesized hundreds of national surveys\nconducted by government agencies and other organizations that include questions about\nreligious identification. The synthesis used the data from these surveys along with\ninformation collected from Pittsburgh-area residents to estimate the size of the Jewish\npopulation in the region.\n Comprehensive list-based sample. The study selected respondents primarily based on\ntheir appearance on the membership and contact lists of dozens of Pittsburgh-area Jewish\norganizations. This approach ensured that anyone in the Greater Pittsburgh area who has\nhad even minimal contact with any area Jewish organization was represented.\n Ethnic names sample. The comprehensive list-based sample was supplemented with a\nlist of households in the area comprised of individuals who have a distinctly Jewish first or\nlast name. Such households typically make up 20-25% of Jewish households in a\ncommunity but are not significantly different from Jewish households that do not have\ndistinctive Jewish names.5\n Multiple survey modes. CMJS approached survey participants by postal mail, phone, and\nemail. Multiple attempts were made to reach each respondent and update contact\ninformation and the respondent’s status when initial efforts were unsuccessful.\nIn consultation with Federation, the geographic focus of the 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish\nCommunity Study included households in Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, and\nWestmoreland Counties. This area is distinct from the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area,2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 7\nwhich also includes Armstrong and Fayette Counties. Although this study focused solely on the\nfive-county area defined by Federation, anyone who lived in an adjacent county and was associated\nin any way with a local Jewish organization was still eligible to participate in the survey.\nThe study was based on a sampling frame of over 81,000 households. From this frame, two\nsamples were drawn: a primary sample of 14,562 households who were contacted by postal mail,\nphone, and email, and a supplementary sample of 14,997 households who were contacted by email\nonly. The primary sample was designed to be representative of the entire community and was used\nas the basis for population estimates and analyses of the community as a whole. The response rate6\nfor this sample was 28.6% (AAPOR RR3) and the cooperation rate7 was 75.3% (AAPOR CR1). In\ntotal, over 2,000 Jewish households were interviewed (Table 1.1). Because households in the\nsupplemental sample were only contacted by email, highly engaged households were expected to be\nmore likely to complete the survey. Accordingly, statistical adjustments were used to account for\nthe different likelihood of response in the two samples. Survey weights were developed to ensure\nthat the full sample—primary and supplemental combined— represented the entire community in\nterms of key factors including age, Jewish denomination, and synagogue membership.\nThroughout this report, for purposes of analysis and reporting, estimates about the entire\ncommunity were derived solely from the primary sample. The combined, or full, sample was used\nfor analyses of subgroups—such as families with children—where the increased number of\nrespondents supported more robust analysis.\nTable 1.1 Summary of survey respondents\nPrimary n Supplemental n Total n\nCompleted eligible households 1,215 896 2,111\nFrom lists 1,200 896 2,096\nEthnic name sample (de-duplicated) 15 -- 15\nTotal households on lists -- -- 81,125\nDrawn sample size 14,562 14,997 29,559\nCompleted screeners 3,778 1,906 5,684\nResponse rate (AAPOR RR3) 28.6% 20.3% --\nUndercounted Populations\nAlthough the goal of the study was to develop a comprehensive understanding of the Jewish\ncommunity, some groups are nevertheless likely to be undercounted and/or underrepresented. In\nparticular, residents of institutional settings such as college dormitories, hospitals, and nursing\nhomes, as well as adults who have never associated with any Jewish organization in the Greater\nPittsburgh area are less likely to have been identified and contacted to complete the survey.\nAlthough we cannot produce a completely accurate estimate of these individuals, the undercounts\nare unlikely to introduce significant bias into the reported estimates. Where appropriate, we have\nnoted the limitations of the methods.8 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nHow to Read This Report\nCommunity studies are household surveys. They are designed to represent the views of the entire\npopulation by interviewing a randomly selected sample of households from the community. To\nextrapolate respondent data to the entire community, the data are adjusted (i.e., “weighted”) by\nassigning each respondent a weight so that his/her responses represent the proportion of the\noverall community that has similar demographic characteristics. The weighted respondent thus\nstands in for that segment of the population, and not only the household from which it was\ncollected. (See Appendix A for more detail.) Unless otherwise specified, this report presents\nweighted survey data in the form of percentages or proportions. These data should be read not\nas the percentage or proportion of respondents who answered each question in a given\nway, but as the percentage or proportion of the population that it is estimated would\nanswer each question in that way had each member of the population been surveyed.\nNo estimate should be considered an exact measurement. The reported estimate of any value,\nknown as a “point estimate,” is the most likely value for the variable in question given available\ndata, but the true value may be slightly higher or slightly lower. Because estimates are derived from\ndata collected from a representative sample of the population, there is a degree of uncertainty. The\namount of uncertainty depends on multiple factors, the most important of which is the number of\nsurvey respondents who provided the data from which any given estimate is derived. The\nuncertainty is quantified as a set of values that range from a value slightly less than the reported\nestimate to a value a similar percentage above it. By convention, this range, known as a “confidence\ninterval,” is calculated to reflect 95% certainty that the true value for the population falls within the\ndefined range. (See Appendix A for details about the magnitude of confidence intervals around\nestimates in this study.)\nWhen size estimates of subpopulations (e.g., synagogue members, intermarried families, families\nwith children, etc.) are provided, they are calculated as the weighted number of households or\nindividuals for which the respondents provided sufficient information to classify them as members\nof the subgroup. When data are missing, those respondents are counted as if they are not members\nof the subgroups for purposes of estimation. Accordingly, all subpopulation estimates may\nundercount information on those least likely to complete the survey or answer particular questions.\nMissing information cannot be imputed reliably in many such cases because the information that\ncould serve as the basis for imputation is also missing. Refer to the codebook (Appendix D) for the\nactual number of responses to each question.\nSome tables and figures that present proportions do not add up to 100%. In most cases, this is a\nfunction of rounding, with proportional estimates rounded to the nearest whole number. In some\ncases, however, this is a result of respondents having the opportunity to select more than one\nresponse to a question. In such cases, the text of the report will indicate that multiple responses\nwere possible. When a table shows “0,” it means no respondents selected that option, “<1”\nindicates that the estimate rounded down to 0, and “--” indicates that there were insufficient\nresponses to report reliable estimates.\nFor simplicity, not all groups will be displayed in all tables. For example, if the proportion of\nrespondents who made a donation to a Jewish organization is shown, the proportion who did not\ndonate will not be displayed.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 9\nReporting Qualitative Data\nThe survey included several questions that called for open-ended responses. These were used to\nelicit more information about respondents’ opinions and experiences than could be provided in the\nmultiple choice or checkbox formats typical of survey questions. All such responses were\ncategorized, or “coded,” to identify topics and themes mentioned by multiple respondents. Because\na consistent set of response options were not offered to respondents, it would be misleading to\nreport weighted estimates of responses to these questions. Instead, we report the total number of\nrespondents whose answers fit a particular code or theme. This number appears in parentheses\nafter the response, without a percentage sign, or in tables labeled as “n” or number of responses. In\nmost cases, sample quotes are also provided, edited for clarity and with identifying information\nremoved.\nComparisons Across Surveys\nAs part of the goal to assess trends, comparisons of answers to a number of questions are made to\nearlier local data (in particular, the 2002 study) and data from national studies (in particular, Pew’s\n2013 A Portrait of Jewish Americans). Although these analyses are informative, comparisons across\nstudies are not as precise and reliable as the data from the present study. Exact comparisons are not\npossible for several reasons. The most important of these, noted above, is that the methods used to\ndevelop sample frames in the present study differ from those used in 2002.\nReport Overview\nThis report begins with a portrait of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community as a whole and\ncontinues with more in-depth looks at topics of relevance to community members and leaders.\nChapter 2. Demographic Snapshot\nThis chapter provides an overview of the composition of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish\ncommunity: its size, demographic characteristics, and geographic distribution.\nChapter 3. Patterns of Jewish Engagement\nThis chapter describes the multifaceted ways in which the Jews of Greater Pittsburgh define and\nexpress their Jewish identities. It uses a set of behavioral measures to characterize Jewish\nengagement based on participation in Jewish life, both communally and individually. This\ncharacterization yields a typology of five patterns of engagement that will be used throughout the\nreport to understand the behaviors and attitudes of members of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish\ncommunity.\nChapters 4-7.

Demographic Snapshot of the Greater Pittsburgh\nJewish Community\nKnowledge of the size, geographic distribution, and basic socio-demographic characteristics of the\nGreater Pittsburgh Jewish community provides context for understanding the character, behavior,\nand attitudes of community members. Pittsburgh Jewry is not homogenous. The ways in which\nPittsburgh Jews identify as Jewish and engage with the Jewish community vary significantly in\nterms of who they are, where they live, their household composition, their ages, and their Jewish\nidentities. This demographic overview describes the size of the community and the basic\ncharacteristics of community members.\nJewish Population Estimate\nThe 2017 community study estimates that the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, as defined by\nthe borders of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh’s catchment area,8 numbers about\n49,200 Jewish adults and children. Pittsburgh’s Jews constitute just over 2% of the area\npopulation.9 From 2002 to 2017, Pittsburgh’s\nJewish population grew by about 17%. The Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community\noverall regional population grew 2% from 2005 Population Estimates, 2017\nto 2016, but the population of Allegheny\nTotal Jews 49,200\nCounty, where the vast majority of the Jewish\nAdults\ncommunity lives, declined by 2%. It is often\nJewish 42,800\nmore appropriate, however, to compare the\nJewish community to the non-Hispanic white Non-Jewish 7,800\ncollege-educated population, which increased by Children\n29% from 2005 to 2016 across both the full five-\nJewish 6,400\ncounty area and Allegheny County alone.\nNon-Jewish 2,000\nTotal people 59,000\nThe findings of previous studies of the Jewish\ncommunity of Greater Pittsburgh indicate that Total households 26,800\nthe size of the community has been relatively\nstable, with a slight overall decline over the past 80 years. The 1938 study,10 the earliest existing\nwritten report, estimated that there were 54,000 Jewish individuals in Pittsburgh. Between 1938 and\n1963, the Jewish population declined to 45,000.11 The 1984 study12 estimated the local Jewish\npopulation at 44,906 individuals, essentially the same as in 1963. Finally, the 2002 study13 estimated\nthe Jewish population at 42,200 individuals.\nJewish Adults\nEstimates of the size of the Jewish population rest on a set of fundamental questions about who is\ncounted as Jewish for the purposes of the study. Recent studies, such as Pew Research Center’s\n2013 A Portrait of Jewish Americans, classify respondents according to their responses to a series of\nscreening questions: What is your religion? Do you consider yourself to be Jewish aside from\nreligion? Were either of your parents Jewish? Were you raised Jewish? Based on the answers to\nthese questions, Jews have been categorized as “Jews by religion” (JBR)—if they respond to a12 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nquestion about religion by stating that they are solely Jewish—and “Jews of no religion” (JNR)—if\ntheir religion is not Judaism, but they consider themselves Jewish in some other way. Jews by\nreligion tend to be more engaged with Judaism than Jews of no religion, but many JBRs and JNRs\nlook similar in terms of Jewish behaviors and attitudes. For the purposes of this study, and to\nensure that Pittsburgh Jewry could be compared to the population nationwide, a variant of Pew’s\nscheme was employed, supplemented by several other measures of identity. Included in the Jewish\npopulation are those adults who indicate they are Jewish and another religion; we refer to this\ncategory as “Jews of multiple religions” (JMR).\nAmong Jewish adults in the Greater Pittsburgh area, 82% (35,100 individuals) identify as Jewish by\nreligion (JBR). This proportion is higher than that of the overall United States Jewish population as\nreported by Pew (78%).14 The remaining Jewish adults (18%) identify as Jews of no religion (JNR)\nor Jews of multiple religions (JMR). A little more than half of these individuals (4,300) have no\nreligion but say they consider themselves Jewish for ethnic or cultural reasons. The remainder\n(3,400) consider themselves to be Jewish along with another religion.15\nJewish Households\nPittsburgh’s Jewish population resides in an estimated 26,800 households. Households are\nclassified as Jewish if they include at least one Jewish adult (Table 2.1).\nAdults and children who live in Jewish households include Jews and non-Jews (Table 2.2). Non-\nJewish adults include three groups: those who report that they are not Jewish in any way (listed as\nnot Jewish); those who say they are Jewish but were not born to Jewish parents, were not raised\nJewish, and did not convert (listed as Jewish affinity); those who have Jewish parents or were raised\nJewish but do not currently consider themselves to be Jewish in any way (listed as Jewish\nbackground). Non-Jewish children include those who are being raised with no religion or a religion\nother than Judaism. Of the non-Jewish children, nearly all are being raised with no religion or their\nparents have not yet decided on their religion.\nJewish households in Greater Pittsburgh include an estimated 7,800 non-Jewish adults and 2,000\nnon-Jewish children. These 9,800 individuals bring the total population of people living in Jewish\nhouseholds in the region to approximately 59,000 people (50,600 adults and 8,400 children).\nTable 2.1 Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh area, summary (rounded to nearest 100)\nChange\n2017 2002\n2002 to 2017\nHouseholds with at least one Jewish adult 26,800 20,900 28%\nTotal Jewish adults and children 49,200 42,200 17%\nTotal people in Jewish households 59,000 54,200 9%2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 13\nIn addition to the adults listed here, the study found fewer than 500 adults who have a Jewish\nbackground but do not consider themselves Jewish in any way and do not live with any other\nJewish adults. These individuals are not included in Table 2.2. The study also found fewer than\n400 adults of Jewish affinity who live outside of Jewish households in the Pittsburgh area.

Age of Jewish adults in\nthe US Jewish community as a whole. The mean age of\nPittsburgh’s Jewish adults based on the present Pittsburgh and nationally (%)\npopulation estimate is 51 and the median is 54, older\nthan the median age of Jewish adults nationally, 50.16 The Pittsburgh National17\nmean age of all Pittsburgh Jews is 45 and the median is\n18-34 24 28\n50.

The largest shares of the adult Jewish population are between ages\n18-29 and 60-69. There are notably fewer Jews in their 30s and 40s.\nTwo indicators suggest that the community may be getting younger. Younger adults, ages 18-29,\nconstitute nearly one-fifth (18%) of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish population. Thirty-eight percent\nof these young adults are married, cohabiting, or engaged, but only 1% have children. Additionally,\nnearly 40% of children being raised Jewish in some way in the community are ages 0-5 (see\nChapter 4). Taken together, these developments signal that the community may expect to see\ncontinued growth.\nOverall, the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community has more females than males (53% and 47%,\nrespectively), with 1% of adults identifying as a gender other than male or female.\nFigure 2.1 Age-gender distribution of Jews in Greater Pittsburgh (% of Jewish individuals)18\n90+ 1 1\n80s 2 3\n70s 5 4\n60s 10 8\n50s 9 7\n40s 4 3\n30s 5 7\n18-29 10 8\n10-17 3 3\n0-9 4 4\nFemale Male2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 15\nHousehold Composition\nHouseholds with children under age 18 (comprising single-parent, two-parent, or multigenerational\nhouseholds) make up 18% of Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh (Figure 2.2). The remaining\nhouseholds consist of single adults (28%), couples without children (31%), and households with\nparents and adult children living together (multigenerational households; 14%). Among households\nin which a single adult resides, 33% are seniors ages 65 and older, 41% are 50-64, and the\nremaining 26% are 18-49 years of age.\nFigure 2.2 Household composition (% Jewish households)\nRoommates\nChildren\n8%\n18%\nSingle adult\n28%\nCouple, no\nchildren\nMultigenerational\n31%\n14%\nOverall, about three-fifths of households (61%) include a married, engaged, or cohabiting couple,\nliving with or without children or other relatives.

Those in the youngest age group, ages\n18-34, are least likely to be married or partnered (48%), but of those who are, 60% have a Jewish\nspouse/partner. The proportion of households that include a married couple, as well as the\nintermarriage rate, are similar to what was found in 2002.20\nJewish Young Adults\nYoung adults, ages 18 to 44, constitute 37% of Pittsburgh’s adult Jewish population. Nearly one-\nquarter are students, with 18% attending school full-time and 5% attending part-time. The majority\n(68%) of students are undergraduates, with the rest in graduate or professional programs. Two-in-\nthree (64%) young adult Jews identify with a specific denomination. Eleven percent are Orthodox,\n22% are Conservative, and 26% are Reform. Overall, 61% of Jewish young adults are married or\nliving with a partner or significant other. Of these, 54% are married to or living with someone who\nis Jewish. Among the 39% of Jewish young adults who are not married or living with a partner or\nsignificant other, 8% are currently dating. There are not enough data to know how many of these\nyoung adults are dating Jews.\nOther Groups\nMultiple stakeholders in the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community expressed interest in other\ngroups of Jews living in the area, including Israelis, LGBTQ Jews, and Jews of color. Too few\nrespondents were interviewed to be able to estimate characteristics of these groups. Only the sizes\nof these groups could be estimated with any reliability. Three percent of the adult Jewish\npopulation are Israeli, and 3% are LGBTQ. One percent are Jews of color or of Hispanic or Latino\norigin.21 Eleven percent of Jewish households include someone who identifies as Sephardic or\nMizrachi.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe Jews of Greater Pittsburgh can be divided among five regions: Squirrel Hill (the most\nconcentrated Jewish neighborhood), the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, the South Hills, the North\nHills, and the surrounding suburbs. The distribution of Jews in Greater Pittsburgh is described in\nTable 2.8. The community continues to grow in its traditional enclave of Squirrel Hill, but since\n2002, a greater share of newcomers has chosen to live in other areas within the region. Maps\nshowing the distribution of Jewish households appear below (Figures 2.3 and 2.4).\nAbout half (55%) of Jewish adults ages 50-64 live outside the city of Pittsburgh (Table 2.9). About\ntwo-thirds of each other age group live in the city. Nearly half (48%) of Jewish children are being\nraised in Squirrel Hill.18 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nFigure 2.3 Dot density map of Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh area\nNorth Hills South Hills Squirrel Hill Rest of Pittsburgh ● 1 dot = 50 households\nNote: Dots are randomly placed within the ZIP codes in which they reside.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 19\nFigure 2.4 Dot density map of Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh area (detail view of\nPittsburgh)\nNorth Hills South Hills Squirrel Hill Rest of Pittsburgh ● 1 dot = 50 households\nNote: Dots are randomly placed within the ZIP codes in which they reside.20 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nReasons for Moving to Pittsburgh\nRespondents who moved to the Pittsburgh area in the last five years were asked why they moved\nto the area. Overall, 186 respondents provided answers, which were coded thematically. The most\ncommonly cited reasons were for a job (72), to study in a particular college or university (55), or to\nbe closer to family (32).\nPlans to Move Away\nOf all Jewish adults, 18% have plans to move out of the Pittsburgh area in the next three years,\nthough nearly one-third of these are current students. Overall, 181 respondents provided at least\none reason why they planned to move. Forty-one of these respondents are currently students, who\nexpect to graduate and move away to pursue further educational opportunities or begin their\ncareers. Among all respondents, the most frequently cited reasons for moving away were for a job\n(50), for family reasons (31), to study (27), to retire (14), or for the opportunity to live somewhere\nwith better weather (12).\nTable 2.8 Geographic distribution of Pittsburgh’s Jews\nJewish Jewish\nGeographic region22\nhouseholds individuals\nSquirrel Hill 26 30\nRest of Pittsburgh 31 26\nSuburbs: 43 44\nSouth Hills (Mt.

Patterns of Jewish Engagement\nThe diversity of Greater Pittsburgh Jewry is reflected not only by the varied demographics of the\nresidents, but in the many types of Jewish identification and means of engagement in Jewish life.\nExamining the ways in which Pittsburgh-area Jews not only view, but also enact their Jewish\nidentities, is necessary to understand this population and the ways in which Jewish life in the region\ncan be enhanced.\nBackground: Classifications of Jewish identity\nAs discussed in Chapter 2, many Jewish demographic studies, including most recently Pew (2013),\nclassify Jewish adults as either “Jewish by religion” (JBR; they respond that they are “Jewish” when\nasked about their religious identity) or “Jews of no religion” (JNR; they consider themselves to be\nJewish in a way other than religion). For purposes of this report and comparability with other\nstudies, we used a variant of this set of classifications for the population estimates.\nAlthough research has shown that Jewish adults who are “JBR” are, overall, more engaged Jewishly\nthan those who are “JNR,” these classifications are too broad to provide insight about the range of\nJewish behaviors and attitudes within each group. We developed a new set of categories specifically\nfor this study that are based on behavior rather than self-identification. We refer to these categories\nas the “Index of Jewish Engagement.”\nIndex of Jewish Engagement\nWe specifically designed the Index of Jewish Engagement to identify opportunities for increased\nengagement for groups with different needs and interests. The Index focuses on the ways in which\nindividuals occupy and involve themselves in Jewish life. Such behaviors are concrete and\nmeasurable expressions of Jewish identity. In many cases, behaviors are correlated with\ndemographic characteristics, background, and attitudes. Jewish adults’ decisions to take part in\nactivities may reflect the value and meaning they find in these activities, the priority they place on\nthem, the level of skills and resources that enable them to participate, and the opportunities\navailable and known to them. We are interested in how Pittsburgh-area Jews think about their\nJewish identities and participate in Jewish life.\nTo develop the Index, we selected a range of Jewish behaviors that were included in the survey\ninstrument. The set of Jewish behaviors used to develop the typology are inclusive of the different\nways—public and private—that contemporary Jews engage with Jewish life. Cultural activities, such\nas participation in educational programs, reading Jewish literature, and using Jewish sources on the\nweb are included in addition to religious activities, such as attendance at religious services and\nobservance of Jewish laws of Shabbat and kashrut. Some of the activities are located primarily\nwithin institutions (e.g., synagogue membership), while others are home-based (e.g., Passover\nseders). These behaviors are classified into four dimensions of Jewish life: family and home-based22 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\npractices, ritual practices, personal activities, and organizational participation. The behavioral\nmeasures include:\n Family holiday celebrations: Participating in a Passover seder and lighting Hanukkah\ncandles. Family holiday celebrations are practiced by many US Jews for religious and other\nreasons, e.g., social, familial, cultural, and ethnic. In contrast to High Holy Day services,\nthese can be practiced at home without institutional affiliation.\n Ritual practices: Keeping kosher, lighting Shabbat candles or having a Shabbat dinner,\nattending religious services regularly, attending High Holy Day services, fasting on Yom\nKippur.\n Personal activities: Engaging in cultural activities (book, music, TV, museum), reading\nJewish material (newsletter, website), following news about Israel.\n Communal activities: Belonging to a synagogue, belonging to a JCC or other Jewish\norganization, attending Jewish activity, volunteering for Jewish organizations, donating to\nJewish causes.\nWe employed a statistical tool, latent class analysis (LCA),23 to cluster similar patterns of behavior\nbased on respondents’ answers to survey questions. LCA identifies groups of behaviors that\n“cluster” together by analyzing patterns of responses. The result of the LCA analysis was the\nidentification of five unique patterns of Jewish engagement.\nPatterns of Jewish Engagement\nWithin the set of behaviors listed above, Jewish individuals make unique choices regarding their\nparticipation in Jewish private and communal life. Nonetheless, individual sets of choices can be\nclustered into patterns of behavior that are similar to one another. Applying LCA to the data from\nthe survey responses yielded five distinct patterns of behavior and engagement with Jewish life in\nGreater Pittsburgh. The patterns are summarized in Figure 3.1 and described below. Table 3.1\nshows, for each pattern, the level of participation in each of the 15 behaviors that were used to\nconstruct the Index of Jewish Engagement.\nUsing LCA, each Jewish adult in the community was classified into one of the five engagement\ngroups according to the pattern that most closely matches the individual’s participation in different\ntypes of Jewish behaviors. The classification enables us to understand the characteristics of people\nwho participate in Jewish life in different ways: the demographics, background, and attitudes that\nare associated with each pattern of participation. For purposes of this report, the names of the\nengagement groups will be used to refer to the groups of Jewish adults who most closely adhere to\neach pattern. The names of the groups were developed specifically for this study and are intended\nto highlight the behaviors that distinguish each group from the others.\nThe five patterns differ both in degree and types of engagement with a broad set of Jewish\nbehaviors. Two patterns exhibit engagement with all aspects of Jewish life including holiday, ritual,\npersonal, and communal behaviors. For Jews with the “Immersed” pattern, all behaviors are\npracticed by large majorities of the group, with the exception of volunteering and cultural activities.\nThose with the “Connected” pattern have high participation in many of the activities, though less2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 23\nso than the Immersed group. However, the Connected attend Shabbat dinners and services and\nobserve kashrut much less often than do the Immersed.\nTwo groups represent medium levels of engagement. In comparing these two groups, the\n“Involved” group has lower levels of Jewish holiday observance and synagogue membership, but a\ngreater share participate in Jewish personal activities and Jewish organizations aside from\nsynagogues. In contrast, the “Holiday” group has higher levels of kashrut observance, Jewish\nholiday observance, and synagogue membership, but lower participation in Jewish personal and\ncommunal activities.\nThe lowest level of engagement is found in the “Minimally Involved” group, in which only\nminorities participate in any of the activities listed, including 2% of the total population who\nparticipate in none of them.\nAs shown in Figure 3.1, the Connected and Involved patterns describe the largest groups, each\ncomprising 29% of Jewish adults. The Immersed pattern reflects 16% of the Jewish population.\nEach of the other groups accounts for less than one-in-seven Pittsburgh Jewish adults. The\nremainder of this chapter describes the distinguishing characteristics of each of the five groups.\nFigure 3.1 Patterns of Jewish engagement24 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nJewish Behaviors and Jewish Engagement\nAs shown in Table 3.1, the Jewish behaviors across the five engagement patterns vary widely, but\nall patterns include at least some behaviors that represent a connection to Jewish life. This section\nfocuses on the 15 behaviors used to construct the typology of Jewish engagement. Later chapters\nof this report relate these patterns to specific areas of Jewish communal engagement and attitudes\nabout Judaism and Jewish life.\nFamily Holidays\nThe home-based holidays of Passover and Hanukkah are widely observed. They are almost\nuniversal in the Immersed and Connected groups and widespread in the Involved and Holiday\ngroups. Only a minority in the Minimally Involved group observe them.\nTable 3.1 Behaviors used to construct Index of Jewish Engagement\nMinimally\nImmersed Connected Involved Holiday\nInvolved\nFamily holidays\nPassover seder (typically) 100% 98% 77% 70% 10%\nHanukkah (typically) 100% 97% 73% 97% 14%\nRitual\nKosher at home or always 66% 6% 3% 28% 1%\nShabbat candles or dinner\n99% 26% 21% 24% 0%\n(usually/always)\nServices at least monthly 89% 23% 1% 2% 0%\nYom Kippur fast (all or part of\n99% 92% 46% 72% 2%\nday)\nHigh Holy Day services (any in\n100% 95% 8% 42% 0%\n2016)\nPersonal activities\nJewish cultural activities\nweekly or more (book, music, 54% 14% 14% 4% 1%\nTV, museum)\nJewish news or websites\n100% 91% 97% 42% 19%\nmonthly or more\nIsrael news monthly or more 93% 79% 78% 57% 56%\nCommunal activities\nSynagogue member 96% 67% 5% 22% 0%\nOrganization member (JCC,\n79% 64% 58% 25% 10%\nformal, informal)\nOrganization activity in past\n99% 98% 99% < 1% 9%\nyear\nVolunteered with or for a\nJewish organization in past 41% 33% 12% 5% 1%\nmonth\nDonated to a Jewish\n95% 90% 71% 33% 14%\norganization in past year2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 25\nRitual Activities\nOther than kashrut, all ritual practices are observed by almost all of those in the Immersed group.\nObservance of the High Holy Days, through synagogue attendance and fasting on Yom Kippur, is\nnearly universal among those in the Connected group. Among those in the Involved group, almost\nhalf (46%) fast on Yom Kippur, but few (8%) attend High Holy Day services. Less than half (42%)\nof those in the Holiday group attend services on High Holy Days, but a larger share (72%) fast on\nYom Kippur. Very few in the Minimally Involved group follow any Jewish rituals.\nPersonal Activities\nNearly all those from the Immersed group visit Jewish websites and seek news about Israel\nregularly, and half participate in cultural activities weekly. The Connected and Involved groups are\nsimilar in their participation in Jewish personal activities, with over 90% visiting Jewish websites\nand over three-quarters seeking news about Israel regularly. Those in the Holiday group participate\nless frequently, with about half visiting Jewish websites (42%) and seeking news about Israel (57%).\nA minority of those in the Minimally Involved group (19%) access Jewish news and websites, but\nabout half (56%) do seek out news about Israel monthly.\nCommunal Activities\nCommunal activities include memberships and participation in synagogue and organizational life.\nNearly all (96%) of the Immersed group are synagogue members, as are 67% of the Connected and\n22% of the Holiday groups. Few or none of the other groups are synagogue members.\nOrganization membership, activity, and support through donations is highest among those in the\nImmersed group, followed by the Connected and Involved groups.\nDemographics and Jewish Engagement\nRespondents’ demographic characteristics and their patterns of engagement are linked. Tables 3.2,\n3.3, and 3.4 show the distribution of selected demographic characteristics within the Jewish\nengagement categories. To best understand demographic patterns, it is useful to compare the\ndistribution of each demographic category across the engagement groups to that of the overall\nadult Jewish population, shown in the bottom row of each table. This comparison indicates where\neach engagement group differs from the overall population. See Appendix B for a table showing\nthe distribution of engagement groups within each demographic characteristic (i.e., column totals\nrather than row totals).\nNote that the overall rows in these tables do not necessarily match those given elsewhere in the\nreport because they are based only on the subset of Jewish adults who provided sufficient\ninformation for assignment of a Jewish engagement category.\nThere are some age differences across the engagement groups (Table 3.2). The Holiday group has\nthe largest proportion, 38%, of 18-to-34 year olds and the smallest proportion, 17%, of those ages26 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\n65 and over. The Minimally Involved\nTable 3.2 Age by Jewish engagement (% of Jewish adults)\ngroup includes the smallest\nproportion of adults ages 18-34, 6%, AGE 18-34 35-49 50-64 65 + Total\nand fully half of adults ages 50-64.

The Minimally Involved group members have the highest\nrate of parents with minor children (25%), and the Holiday (15%) and Involved (14%) groups have\nthe smallest share of parents.\nTable 3.3 Marriage and children by Jewish engagement (% of Jewish adults)\nInmarried Intermarried\nMarried Unmarried Has children No children\n(of married) (of married)\nImmersed 73 27 84 16 21 79\nConnected 78 22 86 14 19 81\nInvolved 61 39 67 33 14 86\nHoliday 52 48 52 48 15 85\nMinimally\n49 51 16 84 25 75\nInvolved\nOverall 65 35 71 29 18 82\nWithin the Immersed, Involved, Table 3.4 Standard of living by Jewish engagement\nand Holiday groups, about one- (% of Jewish adults)\nthird (of the adults describe\nProsperous / Not\nthemselves as prosperous or very\nvery comfortable prosperous\ncomfortable (Table 3.4).

Tables 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 show the distribution of selected Jewish identity\ncharacteristics across the Jewish engagement categories (row totals) in comparison to the overall\nJewish adult population (last row). See Appendix B for a table showing the distribution of\nengagement groups within each demographic characteristic (i.e., column totals rather than row\ntotals).\nNote that the overall rows in these tables do not necessarily match those given elsewhere in the\nreport because they are based only on the subset of Jewish adults who provided sufficient\ninformation for assignment of a Jewish engagement category.\nJewish denomination corresponds closely to Jewish engagement but is not identical (Table 3.5).\nThe Immersed group has the largest share of Orthodox (46%), the Holiday group has the largest\nshare of Conservative (41%), and the Connected group has the largest share of Reform Jews\n(54%). Of the Minimally Involved group, 81% do not identify with any denomination.\nTable 3.5 Denomination by Jewish engagement (% of Jewish adults)\nOrthodox Conservative Reform Other None\nImmersed 46 32 15 3 3 100\nConnected 2 28 54 7 8 100\nInvolved 1 9 31 3 56 100\nHoliday 2 41 29 3 25 100\nMinimally Involved 0 0 11 7 81 100\nOverall 9 22 34 5 30 100\nAll of those in the Immersed group (100%)\nTable 3.6 Jewish identity by Jewish engagement\nand the vast majority of those in the\n(% of Jewish adults)\nConnected (97%) and Holiday (89%) groups\nare Jewish by religion (JBR; Table 3.6).

The figures below show responses to a set of attitudinal questions that\nillustrate the differences among the groups. As is evident from Figure 3.2, over four-in-five (87%)\nin the Immersed group consider Judaism to be very much part of their daily lives, with the\nproportions in the other groups being much less. The same pattern is evident in response to a\nquestion about whether Judaism is a matter of religion and a community (Figure 3.3). Across all\ngroups, there is general agreement about whether Judaism is an ethnicity—an average of 43% of all\ngroups very much agree. The Minimally Involved are least likely to consider Judaism a matter of\nFigure 3.2 Being Jewish in daily life by Jewish engagement (% very much/very important)\n100\n87\n80\n60\n40\n27\n25\n18\n20 15\n1\n0\nImmersed Connected Involved Holiday Minimally Involved Overall\nQuestion:” To what extent do you feel that being Jewish is part of your daily life?”2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 29\nFigure 3.3 Meaning of being Jewish by Jewish engagement (% very much)\n100\n80 75\n71\n68\n62\n57\n60 54\n51\n49\n47 47\n42 44 43 42 44\n40 39 38\n40 33\n30\n25\n18\n20\n5\n2\n0\nCulture Ethnicity Religion Community\nImmersed Connected Involved Holiday Minimally Involved Overall\nQuestion:” To you personally, to what extent is being Jewish a matter of: Culture, Ethnicity, Religion, Community?”\nFigure 3.4 Aspects of being Jewish by Jewish engagement (% essential)\n100 94\n90\n81\n79\n80 73 74\n69\n65\n59\n57\n60\n46\n40\n34\n20\n0\nJustice and equality Moral and ethical life\nImmersed Connected Involved Holiday Minimally Involved Overall\nQuestions: “Thinking about what being Jewish means to you, how important is working for justice and equality?”\n“Thinking about what being Jewish means to you, how important is leading a moral and ethical life?”30 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nculture compared to the other groups. When it comes to the question of whether justice, equality,\nand leading a moral and ethical life are an essential part of being Jewish, there is general agreement\namong the Connected, Involved, and Holiday groups on the one hand, and the Immersed and\nMinimally Involved group on the other (Figure 3.4).\nThose in the Immersed group feel the strongest connections to the community,24 with 61% of\nadults feeling very connected to the global Jewish community and 52% to the local Jewish\ncommunity (Figure 3.5). An even larger share of the group, 62%, consider it very important to be\nconnected to the local Jewish community. Among the remaining groups, the share who feel\nconnected to the Jewish community is successively smaller but the pattern is similar: a larger share\nfeel more connected to the global community than the local Jewish community, and more people\nbelieve it is very important to be connected to the local Jewish community than feel they are very\nmuch part of that community.\nFigure 3.5 Jewish connections by Jewish engagement (% very much)\n100\n80\n61 62\n60\n52\n40\n29 29\n26 27\n22\n20\n20 17 18 16\n12\n6\n3 2 0 1\n0\nGlobal Local Importance of local\nImmersed Connected Involved Holiday Minimally Involved Overall\nQuestions: “To what extent do you feel like part of a worldwide Jewish community?”\n“To what extent do you feel like part of the Jewish community in Greater Pittsburgh?”\n“To what extent do you feel it is important to feel connected to the Jewish community in Greater Pittsburgh?”2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 31\nChapter 4. Jewish Children\nIn the Greater Pittsburgh area with approximately 6,400 Jewish children, there are 11 Jewish early\nchildhood centers, three Jewish day schools and yeshivot, and 15 part-time schools.25 The\ncommunity is also served by at least 19 summer overnight and day camps.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the choices that parents make regarding how to raise their children\nand how families take advantage—or, in some cases, do not—of Pittsburgh’s Jewish educational\nopportunities. The goal is to describe the landscape of educational programs, including Jewish\npreschools, formal Jewish education programs, both part-time and full-time; as well as informal\nJewish education programs, including camp and youth groups.\nJewish Children\nRaising Jewish children does not start\nTable 4.1 Greater Pittsburgh child population estimates\nwith educational institutions. Parents\nmake initial decisions regarding how\nAge Jewish All children\nto raise their children: Jewish\nreligiously or culturally, no religion, 0-5 2,400 3,800\nmultiple religions, or another religion. 6-12 2,300 2,500\nAmong the 8,400 children who live in\n13-17 1,700 2,100\nGreater Pittsburgh Jewish\nhouseholds, there are 6,400 children Total 6,400 8,400\nbeing raised Jewish (Table 4.1).\nAnother 1,600 children are being raised in no religion. Parents have not yet decided how to raise an\nadditional 200 children. Two hundred children are being raised exclusively in a religion other than\nJudaism.\nOf all children in Jewish households, Table 4.2 Religion of children in Jewish households\nover half (56%) are being raised by (number and % of children)\ninmarried parents, 38% by\nNumber Percent\nintermarried parents, and the\nremainder, 6%, by single parents.

Five percent of children are being raised Jewish and another\nreligion, 19% have no religion, and 2% are being raised in a different religion.32 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nReligion of Children by Household Characteristics\nOverall, 76% of children in Jewish households are being raised Jewish in some way (Table 4.3).\nNearly all parents who are part of the Immersed, Connected, and Holiday engagement groups are\nraising their children Jewish in some way, as are the majority (73%) of parents in the Involved\ngroup. No children with parents who are part of the Minimally Involved group are being raised\nJewish in any way.26 Nearly all children in\nJewish households in Squirrel Hill (90%) Table 4.3 Children raised Jewish by household\nand the South Hills (88%) are being raised characteristics (% of children in Jewish households)\nJewish, compared with just over half of\nOverall 76\nchildren (54%) in the rest of the City of\nPittsburgh and two-thirds (67%) in the ENGAGEMENT\nNorth Hills.\nImmersed 99\nConnected 100\nNearly all children of inmarried parents are\nbeing raised exclusively Jewish, with 86% Involved 73\nbeing raised Jewish by religion and 13%\nHoliday 97\nraised as secular or cultural Jews (Figure\nMinimally Involved --\n4.1).

Nevertheless, these findings\nSYNAGOGUE\nsuggest both a challenge and an\nMember 98\nopportunity for the Greater Pittsburgh\nJewish community. Very few interfaith Non-member 60\nfamilies who are not explicitly raising their\nDENOMINATION\nchildren as Jews have enrolled them in any\nOrthodox 100\nsort of Jewish educational program. As the\nPew study and other research show,27 Conservative 99\nchildren of intermarried parents are much\nReform 86\nmore likely to grow up identifying as\nOther 100\nJewish if they are exposed to high-quality\nJewish educational experiences as children. None 45\nBy contrast, even if parents intend to raise2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 33\ntheir children as Jews, those children who do not participate in Jewish educational programs tend\nto have significantly weaker ties to the Jewish community when they become adults. Should these\nchildren seek to explore their Jewish heritage in the future, their ability to find Jewish programs that\nmatch their interests and feel comfortable will be the two most important factors in determining\nwhether they identify as Jews in adulthood.\nFigure 4.1 Religion raised, children of inmarriage (%)\nNo religion\n1\nSecular/culturally\nJewish\n13\nJewish by religion\n86\nFigure 4.2 Religion raised, children of intermarriage (%)\nJewish by religion\nNot yet decided\n10\n8\nSecular/culturally\nJewish\n23\nNo religion\n43\nJewish & another\nreligion\n11\nAnother religion\n634 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nParticipation in Jewish Education\nJewish education is provided in the context of Jewish preschools; formal classroom settings, such\nas day school and part-time supplementary school; and informal settings, including camp, youth\ngroups, and peer trips to Israel. Overall, nearly one-half (45%) of Jewish children28 are enrolled in\nsome form of formal Jewish education. Table 4.4 shows the overall numbers of children in each\nform of Jewish education. This table also displays the proportion of Jewish children who are\nenrolled in each form of Jewish education, among Jewish children who are age-eligible to attend\nthat form of Jewish education.\nOf Jewish children who are not yet in kindergarten, 28% are currently enrolled in a Jewish\npreschool program (Table 4.4). Formal Jewish education includes part-time and full-time school\nprograms, as well as private tutoring and classes. Almost one-quarter (24%) of Jewish children in\ngrades K-12 are enrolled in part-time schools, including 31% of those in grades K-8 and 15% of\nthose in grades 9-12. For full-time day schools, 19% of K-12 students are enrolled, including 21%\nof K-8 Jewish students and 8% of Jewish high school students.\nIn addition to enrollment in Jewish educational institutions, 11% of children participate in some\nother form of Jewish learning, such as bar or bat mitzvah tutoring, Hebrew or Yiddish language\nlessons, or Rosh Chodesh clubs.\nTable 4.4 Children in Jewish education (number and % of Jewish children)\nJewish student Proportion of age-eligible\nenrollment Jewish children (%)\nJEWISH PRESCHOOL29 600 28\nFORMAL JEWISH EDUCATION\nPART-TIME SCHOOL\nK-8 800 31\n9-12 200 15\nK-12 1,000 24\nDAY SCHOOL30\nK-8 600 21\n9-12 200 8\nK-12 800 19\nJewish tutoring, K-12 500 11\nAny formal Jewish education, K-12 1,900 45\nINFORMAL JEWISH EDUCATION\nJewish day camp, K-12 1,200 29\nJewish overnight camp.

Twenty-nine percent of Jewish\nchildren in grades K-12 attended Jewish day camp in summer 2017, and 16% attended an overnight\nJewish camp. Thirty-seven percent of all Jewish children in grades K-12 attended at least one camp.\nOne-fifth of Jewish children in grades 6-12 participated in a Jewish youth group during the 2016-17\nschool year. Fifteen percent of Jewish high school students have traveled to Israel on a peer trip.\nMore than half (52%) of Jewish children in grades K-12 participated in some form of Jewish\neducation during the 2016-17 school year.\nDrivers of Participation in Jewish Education\nBecause decisions to participate in Jewish education are typically made by parents, those outcomes\nare linked with the characteristics and overall engagement of adults. Tables 4.5 and 4.6 describe the\nhouseholds who participate in various forms of Jewish education. In these two tables, for each\nhousehold characteristic listed, the table shows the proportion of Jewish households with Jewish\nage-eligible children who have at least one child enrolled in that form of Jewish education.\nTable 4.5 Household participation in formal Jewish education (% of households with age-\neligible children who have at least one child enrolled; row %)\nPart-time Day school, Jewish\nPre-K\nschool, K-12 K-12 tutoring, K-12\nOverall 33 27 12 15\nENGAGEMENT PATTERN\nImmersed 64 57 33 36\nConnected 32 41 9 17\nInvolved -- 3 2 3\nHoliday -- 40 7 12\nMinimally Involved -- -- -- --\nPITTSBURGH REGION\nSquirrel Hill 46 28 22 15\nRest of Pittsburgh 37 13 8 8\nSouth Hills 55 37 1 14\nNorth Hills 30 39 1 17\nRest of region -- 24 2 16\nMARRIAGE\nInmarried 40 29 14 17\nIntermarried 38 19 3 11\nSingle adult(s) -- 32 9 11\nFINANCIAL STATUS\nProsperous/very comfortable 43 29 8 13\nNot prosperous 43 30 14 1536 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nFormal Jewish Education: Preschool, Part-time school, Day school\nFamilies in the Immersed group participate in formal Jewish education at higher rates than other\ngroups.\nOne-fifth (19%) of intermarried households with Jewish children in grades K-12 have at least one\nchild in part-time school, in contrast to 29% and 32% of inmarried and unmarried households.\nHouseholds with higher self-described standards of living are just as likely as less affluent families\nto send their children to Jewish pre-schools and part-time schools, but less likely to send their\nchildren to Jewish day schools. About half of households with age-eligible children in the South\nHills (55%) and Squirrel Hill (46%) send their children to a Jewish early childhood program,\ncompared to about one-third in the rest of the city of Pittsburgh (37%) and the North Hills (30%).\nRespondents with children not enrolled in a Jewish early childhood program were asked about the\nmotivating factors behind their choices. No one reason was critical for a majority of parents. More\nthan half (57%) said they were not interested. One-tenth cited cost and 16% concerns over location\nor transportation. Seven percent said they could not find a good fit for their child. One-sixth (16%)\ncited some other reason, including convenience, alternative care plans, a perception of the superior\nquality of secular programs, or an explicit desire to have children cared for in secular settings.\nInformal Jewish Education: Camps and Youth Groups\nFor most forms of informal education, participation follows expected patterns of engagement\n(Table 4.6). Participation is highest among families in the Immersed group. However, Israel travel\nis an exception: households in the Connected group with teenagers are about equally likely to have\nsent a child on a youth trip to Israel.\nParticipation in camp, youth group, and Israel travel is higher for inmarried than intermarried\nfamilies. Israel trips and youth groups are the most common informal education activities for\nintermarried families with Jewish school-age children. Families who are financially prosperous are\nequally likely to participate in overnight Jewish camp as other families. They are, however, less\nlikely to have sent children to high-school Israel group trips.\nParents who did not send their child to a Jewish camp primarily cite a preference for other\nactivities (56%) or a lack of interest (45%). Cost is less widely regarded as an important reason to\nreject Jewish camp (26%). Only 1% cited a lack of an age-appropriate option, while 20% claimed\nsome other reason, including a preference for other summer camps, conflict with family vacations,\nand the lack of good options for special-needs children. Additionally, several families whose\nchildren are enrolled in formal educational programs during the year chose to give their children a\n“break” from year-round Jewish educational programming.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 37\nTable 4.6 Household participation in informal Jewish education (% of households with age-\neligible children who have at least one child enrolled; row %)\nDay camp Overnight Youth group Israel trip\nK-12 camp, K-12 6-12 9-12\nOverall 29 17 22 19\nENGAGEMENT PATTERN\nImmersed 57 38 46 33\nConnected 22 20 32 35\nInvolved 14 14 9 --\nHoliday 15 0 -- --\nMinimally Involved -- -- -- --\nPITTSBURGH REGION\nSquirrel Hill 46 33 20 23\nRest of Pittsburgh 28 19 9 7\nSouth Hills 20 18 31 12\nNorth Hills 15 12 36 29\nRest of region 3 7 -- --\nMARRIAGE\nInmarried 29 23 31 25\nIntermarried 13 5 11 10\nSingle adult(s) 38 36 16 13\nFINANCIAL STATUS\nProsperous/very comfortable 27 24 25 13\nNot prosperous 28 18 29 2838 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 39\nChapter 5. Synagogue and Ritual Life\nReligious and ritual observance constitute one way Pittsburgh Jews express their Jewish identities.\nSynagogues have long been the central communal and religious “home” for American Jews, and\nmembership in a congregation is one of the key ways Jews affiliate with the Jewish community.\nSynagogue membership notwithstanding, many Jews participate in rituals on a daily or intermittent\nbasis at home. Some Jews perform rituals for religious reasons, while other Jews are motivated by\ncivic, familial, and cultural reasons.\nSynagogues and Congregations\nIn the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, 35% of households (approximately 9,400) belong to a\nsynagogue or another Jewish worship community of some type (Table 5.1). Thirty-eight percent of\nJewish adults live in synagogue-member households, comparable to that of the rest of the country\n(39%) but lower than rates found in 2002 (53%).\nSynagogue affiliation models appear to be changing. In many cities, even as overall synagogue\nmembership rates are declining, alternatives to “brick-and-mortar” synagogues such as independent\nminyanim have grown in popularity, and voluntary contributions have replaced dues in some\ncongregations.31 For this study, respondents indicated whether they were members of “a Jewish\ncongregation, such as a synagogue, temple, minyan, chavurah, or High Holy Day congregation.”\nMembers were asked to name each congregation (up to five) and, for each one, to indicate whether\nthey pay dues, consider themselves members without paying dues, or dues are not required for\nmembership. Using this information, all congregations that could be identified were coded with a\ntype and denomination. One-fifth of\nJewish households (19%) indicate Table 5.1a Synagogue membership (% of Jewish\nthat they are dues-paying members of households; row %)\na brick-and-mortar synagogue (Table\nAny synagogue Brick-and-mortar,\n5.1a).\nmember dues-paying\nOverall 35 19\nSynagogue membership is nearly\nENGAGEMENT\nuniversal among those in the\nImmersed 94 50\nImmersed group (94%), and nearly\nConnected 63 45\ntwo-thirds (63%) of those in the\nConnected group and about one-fifth Involved 4 2\n(21%) of the Holiday group are Holiday 21 5\nsynagogue members.

Pittsburgh’s longest-term Jewish residents are less\nlikely to be members of a congregation (30%); most who are members belong to congregations\nwith traditional building or membership structures. About half (54%) of inmarried households are\nsynagogue members of any type, compared to about three-tenths (30%) of intermarried\nhouseholds. Although adults ages 18-34 are as likely as those 65 and older to belong to any type of\ncongregation, very few of the former group pay dues to a brick-and-mortar synagogue. As might be\nexpected, nearly all (90%) Orthodox Jews are members of a congregation of some sort. Nearly half\nof Pittsburgh’s Orthodox Jewish population are dues-paying members of brick-and-mortar\nsynagogues. However, a higher proportion than otherwise might be expected are members of\ncongregations that do not require dues for membership. The strong presence of Chabad\nthroughout the Greater Pittsburgh area partially explains this finding.\nTable 5.1b Synagogue membership (% of Jewish households; row %)\nAny synagogue Brick-and-mortar,\nmember dues-paying\nLENGTH OF RESIDENCE\n< 10 years 39 6\n10-19 years 32 17\n20 + years 30 19\nHOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE\nInmarried 54 37\nIntermarried 30 6\nSingle adult(s) 21 13\nHousehold has child(ren) 34 17\nNo children 31 17\nRESPONDENT AGE\n18-34 35 3\n35-49 25 14\n50-64 25 16\n65 + 36 28\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 90 45\nConservative 57 25\nReform 40 30\nOther 25 18\nNone 5 22017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 41\nAmong synagogue member Table 5.2 Household membership in congregations of\nhouseholds, 76% are dues-paying different types (% of synagogue member households)\nmembers of brick-and-mortar\nsynagogues, and 12% indicate that Congregation type % of households\nthey are members of synagogues but\nBrick-and-mortar synagogue, pays dues 76\ndo not pay dues—including those\nBrick-and-mortar synagogue, doesn’t pay dues 12\ncongregations where dues are not\nrequired (Table 5.2).

Five percent of member households belong to synagogues that\nare out of the region, and 22% belong to congregations that could not be identified from the\nresponses. Eleven percent of member households belong to multiple synagogues or worship\ngroups. In all, 2% of member households belong to both a brick-and-mortar synagogue and an\nalternative.\nTable 5.3 Denomination of brick-and-mortar synagogues\n(% of brick-and-mortar member households)\nAmong households who are\nmembers of brick-and-mortar\n% of households\nsynagogues, nearly all (93%)33 are\nmembers of Orthodox (20%), Orthodox 20\nConservative (24%) or Reform\nConservative 24\n(52%) congregations (Table 5.3).\nEight percent are members of Reform 52\nsynagogues with other\nOther denomination, nondenominational 8\ndenominations (e.g., Renewal or\nReconstructionist) or no Note: Total exceeds 100% because some households are members of\nmore than one type of congregation.\ndenomination.\nOf households that do not currently belong to a synagogue, 40% (or 26% of all households)\nformerly did so. Respondents who indicated that no one in their households were members of\nJewish congregations were asked to identify the reasons why they were not members. About half\n(45%) of these respondents indicated that they did not join because they were not religious, one-\nquarter cited the cost of membership, and one-quarter indicated membership was not a priority.\nSeventeen percent had not joined because of the lack of a good fit for them, and 12% said they\nwere not members because they had no children at home.\nRespondents were also given the opportunity to cite other reasons for not joining a synagogue, and\n120 did so. Of these, the most common reasons cited were not liking the rabbi or the leadership of\nthe congregation (15) and social reasons, such as not feeling welcome (10). Small numbers of\nrespondents cited other reasons such as not going often enough or political disagreement with\nmembers or congregational leaders, and others indicated plans to join in the future.42 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nSeveral respondents elaborated on their reasons for not joining a synagogue. One wrote, “They\nnever seemed interested in childless adults.” Another said he or she has donated to and attended\nHigh Holy Day services at a local congregation for decades but did not join. One respondent felt\nthere was too much pressure to volunteer: “Chairing a committee and participating on others didn’t\nseem enough for some reason.”\nSynagogue Participation\nBoth members and non-members of synagogues participate to varying degrees in synagogue life,\nincluding attending religious services or other synagogue-based programs, volunteering, or\ndonating (Tables 5.4a and 5.4b). Over three-quarters (79%) of Jewish adults attended at least one\nreligious service in the past year, with attendance nearly universal among those who are part of the\nImmersed and Connected groups. Almost one-quarter of adult Jews (24%) attended monthly or\nmore, and 52% attended High Holiday services. Nearly all (89%) of those in the Immersed group\nand three-fifths (60%) of those in the Connected group say they “very much” felt comfortable the\nlast time they attended services, compared to, on average, one-third of respondents in the other\nengagement groups. Notably, the Immersed group is the only engagement group in which a\nmajority say their spiritual needs were “very much” met the last time they attended services, as well\nas the only group in which a minority say they felt at all disconnected from the people in the\ncongregation. The only substantial difference by region is that those who live in Squirrel Hill are\nmost likely to report they attended services monthly or more, and South Hills residents are far less\nlikely to have attended High Holy Day services.\nTable 5.4a Synagogue participation (% of Jewish adults)\nAttended Attended\nAttended Felt Spiritual Felt\nservices High Holy\nservices comfortable, needs met, disconnected,\nmonthly or Day\never very much very much at all\nmore services\nOverall 79 24 52 57 25 62\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 100 89 100 89 58 32\nConnected 97 23 95 60 29 62\nInvolved 52 1 8 37 9 82\nHoliday 64 2 42 36 8 69\nMinimally Involved 5 0 0 16 6 88\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 78 35 66 62 35 57\nRest of Pittsburgh 67 22 52 54 26 60\nSouth Hills 55 10 30 71 19 64\nNorth Hills 71 13 57 49 25 69\nRest of region 69 21 51 40 22 722017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 43\nTable 5.4b Synagogue participation (% of Jewish adults)\nAttended Attended\nAttended Felt Spiritual Felt\nservices High\nservices comfortable, needs met, disconnected,\nmonthly Holiday\never very much very much at all\nor more services\nLENGTH OF\nRESIDENCE\n< 10 years 84 36 70 60 23 67\n10-19 years 71 25 52 45 25 77\n20 + years 65 20 49 57 28 59\nHOUSEHOLD\nSTRUCTURE\nInmarried 80 29 68 55 29 63\nIntermarried 50 14 34 53 26 62\nSingle adult(s) 65 20 43 59 24 62\nHousehold has\n69 21 56 57 26 70\nchild(ren)\nNo children 69 23 52 56 30 61\nRESPONDENT\nAGE\n18-34 89 28 62 66 23 69\n35-49 66 18 49 49 33 66\n50-64 60 19 49 55 26 59\n65 + 61 23 48 54 29 57\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 99 82 93 87 75 32\nConservative 80 33 74 59 22 52\nReform 82 21 65 58 29 63\nOther 79 19 62 50 14 74\nNone 40 2 13 34 5 89\nSYNAGOGUE\nMember 96 50 92 73 44 51\nNon-member 54 7 30 42 13 7244 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nNewcomers to the community attended services more frequently than more established residents\nand were most likely to say they “very much” felt comfortable and that their spiritual needs were\nmet the last time they attended services (Table 5.4b). Young adults were also among the most\nfrequent attendees and among the most content in their experience at services.\nRitual Practices\nThe majority of Pittsburgh’s Jewish adults mark Jewish holidays over the course of the year, with\n79% lighting Chanukah candles and 76% attending a Passover seder (Tables 5.5a and 5.5b).\nChanukah celebrations are nearly universal among the Immersed, Connected, and Holiday\nengagement groups but less frequent among members of the Involved and Minimally Involved\ngroups. By contrast, Shabbat candle-lighting is widespread among those in the Immersed group but\nis less frequent for all other groups. Notably, residents of South Hills were less likely to participate\nin most of the rituals assessed in this study than residents of other areas.\nTable 5.5a Ritual practices (% of Jewish adults)\nLight Attend Ever light Have Fast on Observe\nHanukkah Passover Shabbat Shabbat Yom any kosher\ncandles seder candles meal Kippur* law\nOverall 79 76 45 31 56 40\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 100 100 96 94 86 90\nConnected 97 98 52 24 75 37\nInvolved 73 77 44 20 40 23\nHoliday 97 70 16 21 53 43\nMinimally Involved 14 10 5 0 1 4\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 85 87 58 43 66 43\nRest of Pittsburgh 77 80 38 30 46 31\nSouth Hills 68 58 42 40 47 43\nNorth Hills 88 84 33 16 58 26\nRest of region 84 71 40 24 58 37\n*Note.

They volunteer and donate their time to Jewish\nand non-Jewish causes. Through their participation, they make Jewish friends and strengthen their\nties to the local community. This chapter describes the multiple ways in which Pittsburgh-area Jews\ninteract and participate with their local peers and institutions and points to measures that can\nenhance these connections.\nOrganizations and Activities\nPittsburgh-area Jews participate in a wide range of Jewish organizations and activities. Three-in-ten\nhouseholds say they currently belong to a Jewish Community Center (JCC) (two-in-ten pay dues),\nand nearly one-third (32%) of households belong to at least one Jewish organization other than a\nsynagogue or JCC, such as Hadassah or AIPAC (Table 6.1a). Overall, one-fifth (21%) of Jewish\nhouseholds pay dues to a Jewish organization aside from a synagogue or the JCC.\nTable 6.1a Household memberships and activities (% of Jewish households)\nOther organization\nJCC member Other organization\nmember\n(dues and no dues) (dues)\n(dues and no dues)\nOverall 30 32 21\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 34 45 32\nConnected 27 54 37\nInvolved 36 42 32\nHoliday 13 4 0\nMinimally Involved 8 1 0\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 40 43 32\nRest of Pittsburgh 25 30 21\nSouth Hills 29 28 22\nNorth Hills 12 30 18\nRest of region 6 23 1348 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nThose in the Connected group are most likely to be members of an organization.

A little over one-fifth of residents who have resided in Greater\nPittsburgh for at least 10 years pay dues to a Jewish organization other than a synagogue or JCC,\ncompared to about one-in-ten residents who have been in the area fewer than ten years (Table\n6.1b).

Seven-in-ten\n(68%) read a Jewish organization’s materials in the past year, with 36% doing so at least monthly,\nand 32% doing so less than monthly. Those in the Immersed and Connected groups are most likely\nto pay dues, attend programs, and read organizations’ materials. The Involved group is\ndistinguished from the remaining engagement groups by the moderate level of participation in the\ncommunity across these items.\nResidents of Squirrel Hill attend Jewish programs more frequently than residents of other\nneighborhoods, likely because most of the programs are hosted by institutions in the\nneighborhood. In turn, because programs are more accessible to residents of Squirrel Hill, it is\nlikely that they read materials from Jewish organizations more frequently due to their connections\nwith those organizations.\nTable 6.2a Organizational participation in past year (% of Jewish adults)\nAttend program Read materials\nMonthly + < Monthly Monthly + < Monthly\nOverall 11 34 36 32\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 37 39 79 17\nConnected 11 53 54 33\nInvolved 7 38 35 58\nHoliday 0 < 1 0 0\nMinimally Involved 2 3 0 5\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 19 41 49 28\nRest of Pittsburgh 14 40 45 27\nSouth Hills 7 23 25 32\nNorth Hills 4 25 33 36\nRest of region 3 24 29 3350 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nSixty percent of newcomers have attended programs in the Jewish community in the past year, and\nthey are among the most frequent attendees as well., but younger adults, especially those ages 18-\n34, attend programs most frequently (Table 6.2b).\nTable 6.2b Organizational participation in past year (% of Jewish adults)\nAttend program Read materials\nMonthly + < Monthly Monthly + < Monthly\nLENGTH OF RESIDENCE\n< 10 years 23 37 39 26\n10-19 years 19 34 43 34\n20 + years 8 33 39 30\nHOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE\nInmarried 14 44 51 31\nIntermarried 13 22 31 25\nSingle adult(s) 8 26 29 32\nHousehold has child(ren) 12 38 35 24\nNo children 12 33 41 31\nRESPONDENT AGE\n18-34 18 29 38 30\n35-49 11 34 40 28\n50-64 10 32 38 25\n65 + 10 40 44 34\nSYNAGOGUE\nMember 18 49 62 24\nNon-member 8 25 27 33\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 22 40 77 18\nConservative 19 33 51 22\nReform 10 43 40 35\nOther 9 45 45 20\nNone 6 21 21 342017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 51\nSources of Information\nTable 6.3 Sources of information (% of Jewish adults)\nMore than half of the community say\nthey learn about Jewish events and\nprograms online (56%), from family Online 56\nor friends (51%), or from synagogue\nFamily or friends 51\nor organizational newsletters (44%)\n(Table 6.3).

Education is very important to 83% of the\ncommunity, and all engagement groups value that cause highly. Nearly as many believe that health\nand medicine (79%) is very important, as do almost three-quarters about social justice and women’s\nrights. Those in the Immersed group assign greater weight to causes related to Israel than do\nindividuals from other groups. In every other engagement group, Israel appears to be less\nimportant than every other topic respondents were asked to value.\nUnsurprisingly, older residents, who also tend to be those who have lived in the area the longest,\nbelieve health-related causes are more important than younger residents. Orthodox and\nConservative Jews believe Israel is more important than adherents to other denominations or no\ndenomination. The greatest difference between synagogue members and non-members, and\nbetween inmarried and intermarried couples, is also on Israel, with synagogue members and\ninmarried couples expressing greater interest.\nTable 6.6a Very important causes (% of Jewish adults)\nHealth/ Social Women’s Environ- Arts/\nEducation Politics Israel\nmedicine justice rights ment culture\nOverall 83 79 73 72 65 61 59 53\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 85 78 59 56 63 53 44 75\nConnected 81 75 76 79 60 61 67 53\nInvolved 86 83 82 80 76 71 64 54\nHoliday 65 83 74 55 76 67 72 50\nMinimally\n84 89 57 87 57 59 48 30\nInvolved\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 85 77 79 74 71 56 63 51\nRest of\n84 79 82 81 74 76 68 50\nPittsburgh\nSouth Hills 82 88 61 76 59 58 43 58\nNorth Hills 86 78 65 71 55 58 54 55\nRest of region 68 81 55 58 58 61 63 602017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 55\nTable 6.6b Very important causes (% of Jewish adults)\nHealth/ Social Women’s Environ- Arts /\nEducation Politics Israel\nmedicine justice rights ment culture\nLENGTH OF\nRESIDENCE\n< 10 years 74 68 67 67 66 59 53 35\n10-19 years 80 75 72 71 66 68 62 47\n20 + years 83 84 73 75 66 63 62 59\nHOUSEHOLD\nSTRUCTURE\nInmarried 84 79 72 76 64 63 66 58\nIntermarried 80 79 72 67 73 72 69 43\nSingle adult(s) 79 83 71 73 66 57 48 54\nHousehold has\n81 77 70 72 66 58 63 51\nchild(ren)\nNo child(ren) 82 81 72 74 66 64 60 54\nRESPONDENT\nAGE\n18-34 73 77 71 65 75 59 39 50\n35-49 88 80 74 79 66 66 62 55\n50-64 78 81 63 72 56 56 59 52\n65 + 88 86 82 82 73 70 77 55\nSYNAGOGUE\nMember 85 78 74 73 62 55 61 66\nNon-member 80 82 71 74 69 68 60 46\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 93 76 51 44 53 39 40 93\nConservative 68 80 66 59 63 62 62 64\nReform 82 79 77 79 67 59 67 47\nOther 67 73 96 89 84 80 65 30\nNone 88 84 73 84 68 72 57 4656 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nPhilanthropy\nWithin the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, nearly all (93%) Jewish adults report making a\ncharitable contribution in the past year (Table 6.7a).

And then she said another child\nwould have survived the Holocaust because she has blonde hair.\nThese incidents are disturbing, but it is important to emphasize that 84% of Jews in Greater\nPittsburgh report that they did not directly experience any antisemitism in the past year, and most\nwho did experienced relatively minor incidents. The perception of antisemitism in the community\nmay be worse than the reality. Nevertheless, the community must remain vigilant to ensure that all\nof its members feel safe and secure to enjoy a rich life in both the Jewish community and the wider\ncommunity around them.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 67\nChapter 7. Connections to Israel\nThe Pittsburgh Jewish community has strong ties to Israel, grounded in religious, cultural, and\nfamilial connections. For many Jewish adults, Israel is central to their Jewish identity. Travel to\nIsrael is frequent and friendships with Israelis are common.\nApproximately three-fifths (59%) of Pittsburgh’s Jews have been to Israel (Table 7.1a, Figure 7.1).\nOne-quarter (24%) of Jewish adults have been to Israel once, and a similar proportion (28%) have\nvisited more than once. Seven percent, including the 3% who are Israeli citizens, have lived in\nIsrael at some point.\nTravel to Israel has increased since 2002, when 44% of Pittsburgh’s Jews had been to Israel.34\nPittsburgh’s numbers also represents a substantially higher proportion than among US Jews in\ngeneral, of whom, as of 2013, 43% had been to Israel.35\nThose in the Immersed group are the most likely to have been to Israel (86%), followed by those in\nthe Connected group (67%). Among those in the Minimally Involved group, one-sixth (16%) have\nbeen to Israel. Three-quarters (73%) of Squirrel Hill’s Jewish residents have been to Israel,\nincluding 51% who have visited multiple times or lived there.\nTable 7.1a Frequency of Israel travel (row %; of Jewish adults)\nNever Once Multiple Lived/Israeli\nOverall 41 24 28 7\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 14 21 56 9\nConnected 33 28 33 6\nInvolved 43 20 30 7\nHoliday 43 32 10 15\nMinimally Involved 84 9 4 2\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 27 22 42 9\nRest of Pittsburgh 42 25 27 5\nSouth Hills 47 13 29 11\nNorth Hills 43 34 19 4\nRest of region 56 24 16 468 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nTwo-thirds (66%) of inmarried Jews have been to Israel, compared to half (48%) of intermarried\nJews and 57% of those who are unmarried.

Of those who have never been to Israel, one-third (31%) feel not at\nall connected, and 38% feel somewhat or very much connected to Israel. By contrast, only 15% of\nthose who have visited Israel once and 3% of those who have visited multiple times do not feel at\nall connected to Israel. Of one-time visitors, 63% feel somewhat or very connected, as do 86% of\nthose who have visited Israel multiple times, lived in Israel, or are Israeli.\nFigure 7.2 Connection to Israel by frequency of Israel travel (% of Jewish adults)\n100 1 3\n5\n13 15\n13\n31\n80\n24 21\nNot at all\n60\n32 Little\n40 81 41 Somewhat\n60 Very much\n26\n20\n22\n12\n0\nLived/Israeli Multiple visits One visit Never been to Israel70 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nAside from travel to Israel, Pittsburgh-area Jews connect to Israel through their family and friends\nwho live there. Over half (53%) of Pittsburgh-area Jews indicate that they have close family or\nfriends living in Israel. Engagement with Israel is further facilitated by fluency in the Hebrew\nlanguage. Among Jewish adults who are not Israeli, 6% can understand most or all of what they\nread in Hebrew and another 33% can understand some Hebrew. One-third of Pittsburgh-area Jews\nsay they do not know the Hebrew alphabet, compared to 48% of all US Jews.36\nTypes of Israel Travel\nAmong those who have traveled to Israel, about one-third (32%) have gone with a Jewish\norganization on a mission or other sponsored trip, and three-in-ten (28%) have traveled on an\neducational or volunteer program (Table 7.2a). Two-fifths (40%) of those under age 46 who have\ntraveled to Israel have gone on Birthright Israel trips, representing 9% of the overall adult\npopulation. The Connected group has the highest proportion who have gone on a Birthright trip,\npossibly because Jews from the Immersed group were ineligible, having previously visited Israel on\nother peer-group educational trips.37\nTable 7.2a Types of Israel travel (% of Jewish adults who have been to Israel)\nBirthright Education/ Federation/\n(< 46 years old) volunteer org. mission\nOverall 40 28 32\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 48 43 35\nConnected 56 18 50\nInvolved 24 11 21\nHoliday 45 39 16\nMinimally Involved -- 14 22\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 55 31 30\nRest of Pittsburgh 61 22 40\nSouth Hills 16 29 21\nNorth Hills 15 23 39\nRest of region 11 6 442017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 71\nTable 7.2b Types of Israel travel (% of Jewish adults who have been to Israel)\nBirthright Education/ Federation/\n(< 46 years old) volunteer org. mission\nLENGTH OF RESIDENCE\n< 10 years 69 20 28\n10-19 years 55 31 27\n20 + years 18 25 36\nHOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE\nInmarried 50 22 45\nIntermarried 59 15 24\nSingle adult(s) 31 34 21\nHousehold has child(ren) 40 27 38\nNo children 45 24 33\nRESPONDENT AGE\n18-34 51 26 19\n35-49 17 26 47\n50-64 n/a 29 40\n65 + n/a 18 37\nSYNAGOGUE\nMember 44 32 45\nNon-member 43 19 24\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 18 54 20\nConservative 57 29 37\nReform 57 17 47\nOther 51 29 31\nNone 31 15 21\nEmotional Connection to Israel\nFeelings of connection to Israel are intimately tied not only to Israel travel, but also to Jewish\nengagement. The strongest connections to Israel are found among the Immersed group (63% very\nmuch) and the Holiday group (34% very much; Table 7.3). About three-quarters (76%) of Jewish\nresidents of the outer suburbs are somewhat or very much connected to Israel, more than in any\nother area in Greater Pittsburgh. Contrary to the popular stereotype, adults ages 18-34 are among\nthe most connected to Israel in the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, with two-fifths (40%)\nfeeling very connected.72 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nTable 7.3 Emotional connection to Israel (row %; % of Jewish adults)\nNot at all A little Somewhat Very much\nOverall 17 21 30 33\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 9 5 23 63\nConnected 9 27 38 26\nInvolved 21 18 29 32\nHoliday 17 24 25 34\nMinimally Involved 36 42 11 11\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 14 22 26 39\nRest of Pittsburgh 29 20 29 21\nSouth Hills 10 30 17 43\nNorth Hills 16 23 35 26\nRest of region 8 15 37 39\nLENGTH OF RESIDENCE\n< 10 years 21 28 28 23\n10-19 years 23 24 27 27\n20 + years 15 20 28 36\nHOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE\nInmarried 12 20 33 35\nIntermarried 39 23 23 15\nSingle adult(s) 10 24 24 41\nHousehold has child(ren) 29 26 21 24\nNo children 14 21 29 36\nRESPONDENT AGE\n18-34 16 21 23 40\n35-49 35 20 22 22\n50-64 10 27 26 36\n65 + 13 20 34 33\nSYNAGOGUE\nMember 6 18 32 44\nNon-member 23 24 26 27\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 2 1 20 77\nConservative 10 16 32 42\nReform 15 24 38 22\nOther 17 20 23 40\nNone 27 30 18 252017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 73\nNews about Israel\nAlmost half (48%) of Pittsburgh-area Jews follow news about Israel at least once a week (Tables\n7.4a and 7.4b).

Another 25% are aware of a partnership\nregion but cannot identify it. Five percent believe there is no partnership region, and almost half\n(46%) are not sure if there is a partnership region.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 75\nChapter 8. Education, Income, and Health\nThe Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community devotes a significant share of its resources toward caring\nfor families and individuals who have economic, social, and health needs. The relative affluence of\nthe Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, both financially and in terms of human capital, has\nmeant the organized Jewish community has been able to meet many of these needs.\nNevertheless, it is clear that there are some unmet needs in the community. Aside from the\nexpenses associated with affiliating with Jewish organizations, providing Jewish education for\nchildren, purchasing kosher food, and other means of engaging in Jewish life, less affluent families\nare also more likely to be struggling with basic necessities such as adequate housing and good\nhealth. There are underserved households throughout the community, but particularly among the\nOrthodox, families with children, and young adults.\nEducational Attainment and Employment\nThe Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh is highly educated, not only in comparison with the\noverall American population, but also in comparison with the US Jewish population as a whole.\nEighty-four percent of Jewish adults in Greater Pittsburgh have earned at least a bachelor’s degree,\nincluding over half (56%) with at least one post-graduate degree (Figure 8.1). Among Jews in the\nUnited States, over half have attained at least a bachelor’s degree (58%), including one-quarter\n(28%) who have graduate degrees (Pew, 2013). In the US population overall, 30% of adults aged 25\nand older hold bachelor’s degrees, including 12% who hold advanced degrees.38\nFigure 8.1 Educational attainment (% of Jewish adults)\nHigh school or less\n3\nSome college\n13\nBachelor's degree\n28\nGraduate degree\n5676 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nCommensurate with their high levels of education, the Jews of Greater Pittsburgh work in fields\nrequiring significant training, including medicine and healthcare (13%); science, technology,\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (12%); business and finance (12%); and education\n(12%). Substantial proportions also work in the legal system (7%) or social services (6%).\nOver half (54%) of Jewish adults in the community are currently full- (45%) or part-time (9%)\nemployees. An additional quarter of the population (26%) is retired. The remaining one-fifth are\nstay-at-home parents, unemployed, on temporary leave, or studying for a degree.\nEconomic Well-Being and Income\nFor the US Jewish community as a whole, high educational attainment has made the community\ncollectively much more affluent than Americans overall. In Pittsburgh, however, the Jewish\ncommunity’s high rate of college education has made Pittsburgh’s Jews only slightly more affluent\nthan the community around them. Among those who responded to the question about income,\none-in-three (33%) households have total income of $100,000 per year or greater,39 including 14%\nwhose household income was $200,000 per year or greater (Table 8.1). On the lower end of the\nspectrum, 37% indicate their household income was less than $50,000 per year, including 17% with\nhousehold incomes less than $25,000 per year. By contrast, data from the US Census Bureau\nindicate that only 5% of all households in the five-county study area have annual income of\n$200,000 or greater, and 46% have annual income less than $50,000, including 23% under\n$25,000.40\nThe estimates of the proportions of Jewish households in each income bracket have not changed\nsignificantly from 2002. In both studies, similar proportions of Jewish households reported annual\nincome of $100,000 or above (32% in 2002; 33% in 2017), and similar proportions reported\nincome below $50,000 (38% in 2002; 37% in 2017). It is difficult to know whether these numbers\nare similar because income increases tended to occur within income brackets, or whether they\nreflect general stagnation of middle class wages.41 The shifting demographics of the community,\nwith an increase in young adults since 2002, may also have resulted in a similar overall income\nprofile today.\nTable 8.1 Household income (% of households)\nINCOME (of responding households) Jewish households All households\n$200,000 + 14 5\n$150-199,999 5 5\n$100-149,999 14 14\n$75-$99,999 20 13\n$50-$74,999 10 18\n$25-$49,999 20 23\nLess than $25,000 17 232017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 77\nThe survey also asked respondents to indicate Table 8.2 Standard of living (% of Jewish\ntheir self-perceived standard of living (Table 8.2). households)\nOverall, one-third (33%) of the community\ndescribes itself as “prosperous” or “living very Prosperous 7\ncomfortably,” and nearly half (45%) say they are Living very comfortably 26\n“living reasonably comfortably.” But nearly Living reasonably comfortably 45\none-quarter (23%) say they are “just getting\nJust getting along 15\nalong,” “nearly poor,” or “poor,” a possible\nNearly poor 7\nindication of economic vulnerability.\nPoor 1\nOf respondents who answered both the income and standard of living questions, all who indicate\nthat they are “nearly poor” or “poor” report household income below $50,000. By contrast, 10%\nof those who say they are “prosperous” or “very comfortable” report household income below\n$50,000. Of respondents who say they are “just getting along,” four-fifths (82%) report household\nincome below $50,000 and one-sixth (16%) say their household income is at least $50,000 but less\nthan $100,000.\nJewish households in Greater Pittsburgh also display relatively high confidence in their ability to\nafford their own retirement. Seven-in-ten (72%) Jewish households in Greater Pittsburgh are\nsomewhat or very confident in their ability to finance their retirement; the remainder are not very\nconfident, not at all confident, or not sure.\nAlthough there are small differences in economic well-being based on Jewish engagement and\nother demographic groups, most are not significant (Tables 8.3a and 8.3b).

As one measure of economic need,\nrespondents indicated whether they received government benefits or skipped necessities in the past\nyear (Table 8.4). These benefits included Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI); energy or utility assistance; SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program), Medicaid, subsidized housing, or day care assistance; or unemployment\nbenefits. However, it is important to note that some of these benefits are not entirely restricted to\nlow-income households (e.g., SSDI, Medicaid); accordingly, receipt of these benefits is only a\npossible indicator of financial need, not a definite indicator. Overall, 16% of households receive\nsome form of public benefit.\nRespondents were also asked about life changes that had occurred in the previous year that resulted\nin economic hardship. Overall, 14% report encountering such a hardship. Nine percent report a\nchange in health, such as major illness; 7% report a change in employment, such as a reduction in\npay; 2% report a change in family structure, such as divorce; and 1% report a change in housing,\nsuch as foreclosure.\nIn addition to the questions\non public benefits, hardships, Table 8.4 Economic needs (% of Jewish households)\nand insecurities, 24% of\nrespondents are not PUBLIC BENEFITS\nconfident in their ability to SSDI or SSI 9\nsave for retirement, and 4%\nEnergy/utility assistance 7\nsay they have been\nconstrained from SNAP, Medicaid, subsidized housing, or day care assistance 6\nparticipating in Jewish life in Unemployment < 1\nthe community due to\nHARDSHIPS42\nfinancial issues.

Over two-fifths\n(42%) of the Minimally Involved say they are not confident in their ability to save for retirement,\nand 17% of those in the Holiday group say they cannot afford an emergency $400 expense.\nGeographically, residents outside of the city of Pittsburgh and the immediate suburbs are most\nlikely to be unable to afford an emergency $400 expense.

One-quarter (25%) of households\ninclude at least one person who is limited in the amount of work, school, or housework he or she\ncan do as a result of an impairment, disability, or chronic physical or mental health problem. One-\nthird (38%) of households include someone in need of counseling or mental health services. One-\nthird (35%) of those in the Involved group say that someone in the household is limited in the kind\nor amount of work, school, or housework they can do due to an impairment, disability, or chronic\nphysical or mental health condition.\nTable 8.6a Health challenges for anyone in household (% of Jewish households)\nAnyone in poor Impairment/ Require mental\nhealth disability health services*\nOverall 22 25 38\nENGAGEMENT\nImmersed 17 20 25\nConnected 18 30 30\nInvolved 22 35 28\nHoliday 9 27 30\nMinimally Involved 19 21 18\nREGION\nSquirrel Hill 16 31 26\nRest of Pittsburgh 19 27 30\nSouth Hills 17 22 23\nNorth Hills 18 17 32\nRest of region 19 34 25\n*Note: Discrepancies between the overall proportion and the engagement group estimates result from the former being a\nmeasure of households and the latter being a measure of individuals.\nYoung adults ages 18-34 (53%) and households with children (40%) report the highest rates of\nneed for mental health services.

Nine percent indicate that they have a parent living in the area in a household other\nthan their own who requires elder care services. Four percent have parents living in independent\nliving facilities, assisted living facilities, or nursing homes in the Greater Pittsburgh area.\nAdditionally, 2% of households are providing regular caregiving to one or more non-elderly family\nmembers.\nEight percent of households include someone who was constrained by health issues from\nparticipating in the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community in the past year. Of the 120 respondents\nwho shared details on their specific constraints, the most common obstacles are mobility issues\n(54), mental or emotional challenges (22), and chronic illness or disease (21).\nTable 8.6b Health challenges for anyone in household (% of Jewish households)\nAnyone in poor Impairment/ Require mental\nhealth disability health services\nLENGTH OF RESIDENCE\n< 10 years 10 12 39\n10-19 years 22 20 45\n20 + years 23 31 27\nHOUSEHOLD STRUCTURE\nInmarried 23 22 27\nIntermarried 10 21 30\nSingle adult(s) 25 32 32\nHousehold has child(ren) 14 12 40\nNo children 22 29 29\nRESPONDENT AGE\n18-34 24 18 53\n35-49 11 10 36\n50-64 19 24 28\n65 + 24 40 15\nSYNAGOGUE\nMember 21 30 27\nNon-member 20 25 32\nDENOMINATION\nOrthodox 27 26 29\nConservative 9 24 21\nReform 19 36 27\nOther 6 11 34\nNone 31 23 3884 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 85\nChapter 9. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study provides a detailed sociodemographic\nportrait of the Pittsburgh-area Jewish community and describes community members’ participation\nin Jewish communal life, their private Jewish activities, and their attitudes about Judaism and Israel.\nThe study was designed to contribute to a better understanding of contemporary Jewish life in\nGreater Pittsburgh and to inform policy-making and planning by Jewish communal organizations.\nThis chapter highlights the ways in which Greater Pittsburgh’s Jews are engaged with Jewish life\nand identifies a number of opportunities to enhance that engagement over the coming years. Some\nof the key findings of the study of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community are summarized\nbelow, with a focus on findings that can point the way toward planning for the community’s\nfuture. This chapter also contextualizes the findings by including commentary from some of the\nmore than 2,000 survey respondents who shared their perceptions of the strengths of the\ncommunity, the gaps they perceive in communal services, and their thoughts regarding what the\ncommunity could do to make them feel more welcome.\nCommunity Size and Growth\nThe Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community has grown over the 15 years since its last community\nstudy and now includes 49,200 Jewish individuals living in 26,800 households. However, its\ncomposition has shifted. Today, there are proportionally fewer adults in their 30s and 40s, fewer\nfamilies with children, more senior citizens, and more single young adults than there were in 2002.\nThe community appears to be poised for continued growth in the near future, especially if the\nyoung adults and families who come to Pittsburgh for school or work decide to stay in the area.\nThe prevalence of young children indicates the potential for growth as those families age, and the\nstrong regional economy can be expected to attract and retain a skilled workforce in the years\nahead.\nThe size of the community is seen as an asset to many of its members. Although 120 respondents\nmentioned the size of the community as one of its strengths, some considered it to be a large\ncommunity, others a small one. One respondent summarized both views:\nSmall enough that it is not overwhelming, but big enough that there are choices within the community.\nThe People\nAccording to its members, the greatest strengths of the community lie in its people (528), who they\nfind to be united (181), welcoming (145), and supportive (107), and actively engaged with\ncommunity life (85).\nThe community is very active and engaged. It is tight-knit. Lots of opportunities to get involved and participate if you\nlook for them.86 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nThe Jewish community of Pittsburgh is a tight-knit, committed group of individuals dedicated to volunteerism,\neducation, social justice, and providing needed services to children, elderly, and the downtrodden. I am proud to be\npart of this community.\nBy contrast, 35 respondents wrote that a friendlier environment would make them feel more\nwelcome, and 39 desired more outreach to newcomers and less-affiliated people.\nThere is a missing level of outreach to the people who consider themselves Jewish, unaffiliated, and generally younger\nand professional. There does not seem to be a whole lot of room for people generally identified as millennial or in the\n25 to 40-year-old range who have not been raised in the community. It can be difficult to penetrate the established\ncommunity if you don’t already have some kind of way in.\nBeing more accepting and welcoming of people who are new to the region and whose families haven’t lived in the area\nfor generations.\nI think there are some cliques and the personal call or genuine friendliness—not just to get you to come to the event,\nbut once you are there—go a long way.\nOrganizations and Leadership\nPittsburgh’s Jewish community includes many strong institutions. Thirty-five percent of\nhouseholds belong to synagogues, 30% say they belong to the JCC, and 24% pay dues to another\nJewish organization. In addition, 76% of adults make donations to at least one Jewish organization.\nA total of 326 respondents considered Pittsburgh’s organizations and leadership to be one of the\nsources of the community’s strength. Specifically, 79 mentioned leaders, 72 mentioned the JCC, 68\nmentioned synagogues and rabbis, and 48 mentioned the Federation.\nThere are many organizations and events to choose from, and many people dedicated to them, both professionals and\nvolunteers.\nThe JCC is extremely diverse, welcoming, and offers programming that fits my family’s lifestyle, especially because it\nis multi-generational and emphasizes wellness. I am in that building about three to five days a week and thankful it\nexists. I think it is by far the best Jewish organization (in my experience) in Pittsburgh.\nPittsburgh has mostly strong synagogues with excellent clergy and loyal communities that work not only within the\nJewish community, but also reach out to other communities as well. We are a small community, and fairly close\ntogether, which makes it easier to communicate.\nThe Federation is very well run by smart, committed professionals that communicate and work well across all\nsegments of the Jewish community. The JCC is equally well run and an important center for children and seniors.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 87\nFocus on Growth in Squirrel Hill and Beyond\nSquirrel Hill remains both the geographic and institutional center of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish\ncommunity, and the Jewish community is growing there and in adjacent neighborhoods. The\ndensity of the Jewish population and its institutions in Squirrel Hill make it an attractive\nneighborhood for Jewish households looking to be especially active in Jewish life (140).\nI think Squirrel Hill is an amazing asset to the Jewish community. It’s a vibrant oasis of thriving Judaism in the\nheart of the East End (which is the best part of Pittsburgh!). It is concentrated in one area of the city, which is good\nbecause it really feels like a community.\nConcentration in one central area that is a great walkable neighborhood.\nProximity to urban center.\nThe community is also growing in its suburbs in the North and South Hills, where communal\nresources may not be as readily available. These suburbs must be supported to ensure that they will\ncontinue to grow as hubs of Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh. A total of 39 respondents indicated\nthat programs and activities in the suburbs were lacking, and 44 respondents indicated that\noutreach to the suburbs would make them feel welcome.\nMaking an effort to include the suburban communities.\nHave local branches in the suburbs other than downtown Pittsburgh so it’s easier to travel to activities.\nThere definitely seems to be a strong community, however, much of it is focused in the East End part of town. Living\nin the South Hills, despite having two to three temples, there is a feeling that we are a minority and not connected to\nthe stronger community in Squirrel Hill.\nHave more programs in the North Hills. There is very little offered for us here. We come in to the city for our\nworship and programming.\nRecognizing the Jewish families who live in the surrounding area beyond the North and South\nHills, who may not have the same access or opportunities to engage in Jewish communal life, is\nalso important. It may be worthwhile to reach out to Jewish residents and institutions of Beaver,\nButler, Washington, and Westmoreland counties to ensure that they feel the community is meeting\ntheir needs.\nI would like to see a greater connection/inclusion of Greensburg with the Pittsburgh area. We sometimes feel left out\nand that is discouraging, because we would feel so much better if we were ALWAYS included.\nThere should be more available to those outside city limits if needed—Greater Pittsburgh includes Westmoreland,\nWashington, Fayette, Butler, Indiana counties for example—but there is next to nothing available without travel to\nPittsburgh.88 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nPatterns of Jewish Engagement\nThe study was designed to help the Jewish community of Pittsburgh develop programs and\nactivities to enhance Jewish engagement. To aid the creation of initiatives that serve community\nmembers “where they are,” the community must first follow a Talmudic dictum to “go out and see\nwhat the people are doing” and construct their plans based on what they observe. In line with that\ngoal, survey responses were used to develop an Index of Jewish Engagement.\nThe categories that comprise Greater Pittsburgh’s Index of Jewish Engagement provide a new tool\nfor understanding the community. Five patterns of engagement were identified. The Immersed\npattern, which describes 16% of Jewish adults in the community, is actively engaged in all aspects\nof Jewish life: home- and synagogue-based holidays and ritual practices, personal activities, and\ncommunal involvement. The Connected pattern, which describes 29% of Jewish adults, is actively\nengaged in most aspects of Jewish life, but at lower rates than members of the Immersed group.\nThe Involved pattern also describes 29% of Jewish adults, who are highly engaged in Jewish\norganizations aside from synagogues. The Holiday pattern, which describes 12% of Jewish adults,\nreflects people who celebrate religious rituals associated with Jewish holidays but are not\nparticularly involved in synagogues or other Jewish organizations. Finally, the Minimally Involved\npattern describes the 13% of Jewish adults in the Pittsburgh area who are largely unaffiliated and\nhave little to no contact with Jewish organizations or institutions.\nThese patterns are not based on predefined labels; rather, they are developed from community\nmembers’ actual behaviors across a variety of dimensions. The Index synthesizes many of these\nbehaviors and illustrates how they are patterned. It describes how each engagement group enacts\nJudaism and reflects the diversity of behavior within extant demographic and interest groups. Each\ngroup is diverse, including older and younger adults, inmarried and intermarried families,\nhouseholds with and without children, newcomers to the community and those who have lived in\nthe area for decades, and people from all neighborhood groupings in the region. Denomination is\ncorrelated with engagement group, but there are Orthodox individuals in nearly every engagement\ngroup as well as people who do not identity with any particular denomination. Although the groups\nreflect different patterns of behavior, they make it clear that simplistic dichotomies—engaged/not\nengaged and religious/not religious—are inadequate descriptors of the nuances of communal and\nprivate Jewish life in Greater Pittsburgh. Involving each group in Jewish life may require a different\napproach. We hope that the Index will help Jewish organizations in Greater Pittsburgh to think\ncreatively about their engagement efforts.\nReligious Diversity and Collaboration\nThe diversity of Jewish life in Pittsburgh is perceived by its members as a strength. Community\nmembers feel that Pittsburgh offers abundant opportunities for Jews of all denominations and\nlevels of practice (177), and particularly value the ways that the denominations collaborate for\nevents and programs that are open to the entire community (151), specifically mentioning the\ncommunity-wide Tikkun Leil Shavuot (Shavuot study session).2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 89\nThere is a lot of diversity—whatever you are looking for in terms of involvement and community you can likely find a\ncongregation to meet your needs/wants.\nThere are many different synagogues and organizations that people can join in order to practice both the religious and\ntraditional/cultural aspects of Judaism, no matter what branch of Judaism they may practice.\nSo many different people from varying backgrounds and levels of faith, many synagogues and Jewish activities (social\naction events etc.). Great Jewish friends and network. We also have a pluralistic chevra kadisha [Jewish burial\nsociety] that I belong to.\nI like that there is an openness across denominational lines. For the most part it doesn't seem to matter what type of\nJewish person you consider yourself, you are generally welcome at the mainstream Conservative, Reconstructionist, and\nReform congregations.\nActivities that try to bring a cross-section of Jews together such as Mitzvah Day, Jewish Film Festival, etc.\nInvest in Jewish Education\nAs the number of Jewish children in the Greater Pittsburgh area decreased between 2002 and 2017,\nenrollment in local Jewish day schools, yeshivot, and Hebrew schools also declined. Based on the\ndemographic findings of the present study, however, it is likely that the community will have more\nchildren of school age in the coming decade. Nearly 40% of Jewish children in the community\ntoday are ages 0-5, and although adults ages 18-29 constitute nearly 20% of the total Jewish\npopulation, few of these young adults are parents. As they begin to start families, it is likely that the\nnumber of children in the community will grow. It is critical for the community to continue to\ninvest in high-quality Jewish educational programs and be prepared for likely increases in\nenrollment in the next few years.\nPittsburgh’s schools and education system were identified as one of its strengths by 51\nrespondents.\nJCC is the bedrock. JCC and Community Day School are the two most important organizations for the future of the\nPittsburgh Jewish community.\nCommunity Day School is a tremendous asset that provides a top-quality education for families of all Jewish\nbackgrounds regardless of ability to pay and fosters academic success and a love of Israel and Judaism.\nAlthough 51 respondents highlighted the schools and educational offerings, 53 indicated\neducational options that they felt were missing from the community. In particular, most of the 53\nrespondents mentioned the need for adult education, especially for the non-Orthodox and less\naffiliated.\nThere is almost a total absence of adult education, especially free adult education, outside of the Orthodox\ninstitutions.\nI really miss the Agency for Jewish Learning! They were a central location for excellent classes. I also miss the weekly\nmorning Torah study that one of the Reform rabbis used to hold at a local coffee shop. It was a great way to study\nand discuss in an informal setting and still get to work on time.90 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nOutreach to Intermarried Families\nFew intermarried families in Greater Pittsburgh feel very much a part of the local Jewish\ncommunity, but these families have over one-third of all children in Jewish households in the area.\nOf these children, one-third (33%) are being raised exclusively Jewish, and another 11% are being\nraised in both Judaism and another religion. About half of the children of intermarried parents are\nbeing raised either in no religion, or their parents have not yet decided how to raise them. As these\nchildren grow into adolescence and adulthood, it is likely they will wish to explore their heritage.\nIt is noteworthy that, for intermarried families who are raising their children Jewish in some way,\nnearly as many are sending their children to Jewish preschool as are inmarried families. Ensuring\nthat there are high-quality Jewish educational programs available for them is likely key to\ndeveloping their Jewish identities. If the community can increase its outreach to intermarried\nfamilies to make them feel more a part of the community, and if the community can offer them\nprograms that stimulate their interests and meet their needs, there may be a significant opportunity\nto increase their Jewish engagement and encourage their children to develop their Jewish identities.\nInterfaith couples and families felt that there were gaps in programs that met their needs (14) and\nfelt that the community could do more to make them feel welcome (35).\nUnderstand and embrace interfaith relationships—or young-adult children of interfaith relationships as a wholly\nimportant future of the Pittsburgh Jewish Community.\nInterfaith outreach that has Jewish content beyond food and happy hours.\nBe more welcoming of those of us who are patrilineal Jews. Even with conversion and being ethnically Jewish, I’m still\nnot welcomed in some areas of the Pittsburgh Jewish Community.\nWe have a mix of religions in our home, though in practice we only practice Judaism. We found that we were not\nalways welcomed or respected at [our area] congregations. Even Reform ones.\nFocus on Young Adults\nJewish young adults in Greater Pittsburgh defy the stereotype of unengaged, disinterested young\nJews. The vast majority of Jewish young adults ages 18-34 have some level of engagement with\nJewish institutions and activities, and their rates of organizational membership and ritual\nobservance typically match or exceed those of older adults in the community. Overall, Jewish\nyoung adults in the community are pleased with the options available to them to engage in Jewish\nlife, but they would like local organizations that provide young adult programming to work more\ncollaboratively and less competitively.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 91\nYoung adults (57) described the types of programs that would be more appealing to them.\nCohesive young adult Jewish programming (there are a lot of separate groups that can be cliquey and plan over top of\none another).\nA range of social opportunities for 20 to 30-year-olds to meet each other in cultural, non-religious settings and\nprograms that appeal to them.\nArticulate a welcoming, spiritual, and socially aware vision of Judaism divorced from the guilt-ridden, intermarriage-\nis-evil, ‘Judaism must exist for its own sake’ that most Jewish organizations currently use to try to appeal to young\nadults/millennials. Come to where I am and meet my spiritual/religious needs, don’t assume I fit the stereotype from\ndecades ago.\nDiversity of Ages and Family Structure\nCertain subgroups of the community, however, indicated that their needs were not fully met.\nOne possible unmet need is in providing services for those with health issues. Eight percent of\nJewish households in Greater Pittsburgh include someone whose health issues constrained their\nparticipation in Jewish life over the past year. Mobility issues, emotional challenges, and chronic\nillnesses were the most common obstacles. One-quarter of Jewish households in the community\ninclude at least one person who is limited in the amount of work, school, or housework he or she\ncan do as a result of an impairment, disability, or chronic physical or mental health condition.\nTwenty-eight percent of Pittsburgh’s Jewish adults are ages 65 and older, and 93 respondents\nindicated that more services were needed for seniors. The most requested service was housing.\nA senior life care community located within greater Pittsburgh.\nFor those who foresee the need to eventually move from our homes or apartments there is no facility in our area to\nmove without going to a retirement community sponsored by Christian organizations.\nI wish the Jewish community offered more senior residences that are of good quality and not so very expensive.\nAmong Pittsburgh’s Jewish households, 28% include a person living alone. One-third (33%) of\nsingle Jewish adults living alone are ages 65 or older, 41% ages 50-64, and 26% under the age of 50.\nRespondents (50) pointed out the needs for programs geared to singles of all ages, as well as adults\nwithout children. A common theme was that programs were too focused on younger singles, and\non people with traditional family structures.\nThere are no programs for Jewish singles after the age of 30.\nServices for mature singles (such as divorced people). Congregations do not reach out to this group either, which is why\nI stopped membership to the congregation I had belonged to for many years.\nNot everyone has a family. I am single and have no relatives in the area. It often seems as though so much is geared\ntowards families and family life.92 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\nDon’t assume everyone is heterosexual, looking for a partner, and child-oriented.\nAgain....I can’t stress this enough....everything is geared toward the assumption that everyone is always part of a\nfamily.....I am not. I would like to be recognized as a valuable, life-long, contributing member of the Jewish\ncommunity as an individual and not be overlooked or ignored or made to feel that my life experience and perspective\nis irrelevant because I am not part of a family!!!\nPromoting Ties to Israel\nNearly three-fifths of Jewish adults in Greater Pittsburgh have visited Israel at least once. Seven\npercent of Jewish adults say they have lived in Israel at some point, including about 3% who are\nIsraeli citizens. Pittsburgh-area Jewish young adults have participated in Birthright Israel at high\nrates, and many members of the community have visited on other educational or volunteer tours\nor on a mission sponsored by Federation or another Jewish organization. Overall, nearly two-thirds\nof Jewish adults in the community feel somewhat or very connected to Israel, half seek news about\nIsrael at least once per week, and half say they have close friends or family living in Israel.\nDespite these close ties to Israel, only about one-quarter of Jewish adults in the community can\ncorrectly identify Karmiel-Misgav as Pittsburgh’s partnership region in Israel. Another quarter say\nthey are aware that there is a partnership region but cannot identify it. Clearly, there is substantial\ninterest in Israel, and there is likely much that can be done to promote engagement by members of\nthe Pittsburgh Jewish community with their counterparts in Karmiel-Misgav.\nSupport for Families in Need\nCollectively, the Jewish community of Greater Pittsburgh is mostly middle class, but nearly one-\nquarter of the community describes itself as just getting along, nearly poor, or poor. Sixteen\npercent of households receive at least one public benefit that may be a measure of economic\ninsecurity. Four percent have felt constrained from participating in Jewish life due to financial\nissues, particularly as a result of high program costs or fees or the cost of synagogue dues or High\nHoly Day tickets. The proportion of Jewish households with significant economic pressures is\nparticularly high in the outlying areas farther from the geographic center of the community, where\nthe Jewish community has the most resources available to offer assistance. To best serve Jewish\nfamilies in need in the community, it may be necessary to raise the community’s awareness of\navailable resources, particularly for those who live outside of Squirrel Hill and the city of\nPittsburgh, and to raise additional resources to subsidize costs of participation or membership for\nless affluent households.\nThe community’s finances were seen as a strength by 62 respondents, who remarked on the\ncharitable and generous nature of community members.\nA group of people who have the financial capability to support those in the community who need the resources the\ncommunity provides.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 93\nThirty-two respondents said that affordability was a problem at schools, camps, and the JCC, and\n32 said that scholarships and reduced costs would help them to participate in the community, in\nparticular with synagogue and JCC memberships.\nI do feel that there is a big price tag to any organized Jewish community either through synagogue membership or JCC\nmembership. That’s unfortunate for unaffiliated Jews.\nThe membership dues of the JCC are extremely high. There are arrangements for those who cannot afford the dues,\nand the ones who can do not have a problem. Those people who fall into the middle category are most affected.\nI think that there could be more community-based religious services that help make everyone feel welcome, and not\njust people who are able to contribute financially.\nConcluding Thoughts\nThe Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh has increased, and the community shows signs of\nlikely growth in the future. Although many members of the community appreciate its size, religious\ndiversity, and strong institutions, the data suggest many opportunities to strengthen Jewish\nengagement and reach diverse populations. We hope that this portrait of the community will\nstimulate a discussion about how to take advantage of the Pittsburgh Jewish community’s many\nstrengths.94 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 95\nNotes\n1 See Aronson, J.K., Boxer, M., & Saxe, L.

Adults who are Jewish and a second religion, if they were raised Jewish or have Jewish parents,\nare classified by Pew as “Jewish Background” and are not included among the Jewish “count.” This study classifies\nthem as Jews of Multiple Religions and includes them in the count of both Jewish adults and Jewish children.96 2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study\n16 Pew, 2013.\n17 Pew, 2013.\n18 The 1% of the population who identify as neither male nor female are not represented in the figure.\n19 Pew, 2013.\n20 In 2002, 66% of households included a married or partnered couple, and of married couples, 36% were intermarried.\n21 By self-definition; the relevant survey questions, depending on household size and configuration, were, “Do you\nconsider yourself to be a person of color or of Hispanic or Latino origin?” or “Does anyone in your household\nconsider themselves to be a person of color or of Hispanic or Latino origin?”\n22 “Squirrel Hill” is comprised of the ZIP codes 15217 and 15232; “Rest of Pittsburgh” is comprised of the ZIP\ncodes 15120, 15201, 15203, 15205, 15206, 15207, 15208, 15210, 15211, 15212, 15213, 15214, 15218, 15219, 15221,\n15222, 15224, 15227, 15233, 15235, and 15236—it does not include 15106 and 15220, parts of which overlap with the\ncity of Pittsburgh; “South Hills” is comprised of Mt. Lebanon, Upper St. Clair, Chartiers Valley, Keystone Oaks, and\nPeters Twp.: ZIP codes 15017, 15102, 15106 (part of which overlaps with the city of Pittsburgh), 15142, 15216, 15220\n(part of which overlaps with the city of Pittsburgh), 15226, 15228, 15234, 15241, 15243, 15317, and 15367; “North\nHills” is comprised of Fox Chapel, North Hills, North Allegheny, Hampton, Pine Richland, Seneca Valley, Mars Area,\nand Quaker Valley: ZIP codes 15015, 15024, 15044, 15090, 15101, 15116, 15143, 15215, 15237, 15238, 16046, and\n16066; “Rest of Suburbs” includes the remaining portions of Allegheny, Butler, and Washington counties and all of\nBeaver and Westmoreland counties: ZIP codes 15001, 15003, 15009, 15010, 15025, 15027, 15042, 15045, 15046,\n15050, 15055, 15057, 15061, 15062, 15063, 15068, 15071, 15085, 15104, 15108, 15112, 15122, 15126, 15129, 15131,\n15132, 15136, 15139, 15145, 15146, 15147, 15202, 15209, 15229, 15239, 15301, 15601, 15632, 15636, 15642, 15658,\n15666, 15668, 16001, 16002, 16023, 16045, 16053, 16057, and 16063.\n23 A description of latent class analysis and details of how it was applied to our data are provided in Appendix B.\n24 Feelings of connection to the local Jewish community are highly correlated with proximity to the geographic center\nof the Jewish community. Nearly three-quarters (73% of the Immersed group live in Squirrel Hill or the rest of the City\nof Pittsburgh; 66% of Squirrel Hill residents and 38% of residents of the rest of city say they feel somewhat or very\nconnected to the local Jewish community, and 75% of Squirrel Hill residents and 60% of residents of the rest of the\ncity say they feel it is somewhat or very important to feel connected to the local Jewish community. These figures are\nhigher than for other neighborhoods in Greater Pittsburgh. For more details, see Appendix C.\n25 Figures taken from the Pittsburgh Jewish Community Scorecard.\n26 Because people in the Minimally Involved group may be less inclined to participate in a Jewish community survey, it\nis likely that there are some children with Minimally Involved parents who are being raised Jewish in some way.\nHowever, no survey respondent from the Minimally Involved group is raising Jewish children.\n27 See, for example, Sasson, T., Saxe, L., Chertok, F., Shain, M., Hecht, S., & Wright, G. (2015). Millennial Children of\nIntermarriage: Touchpoints and Trajectories of Jewish Engagement. Waltham, MA: Maurice and Marilyn Cohen Center for\nModern Jewish Studies, Brandeis University.\n28 For most of this report, “children” refers to individuals under the age of 18. For the purposes of analyses of Jewish\neducational programs, however, “children” includes 18- and 19-year-old individuals who are currently enrolled in high\nschool.\n29 In addition to the 28% of age-eligible Jewish children who are enrolled in Jewish preschools, 47% are enrolled in\nnon-Jewish preschools, and the remainder are not enrolled in any preschool.\n30 Enrollment figures for day school are rounded to the nearest 100.2017 Greater Pittsburgh Jewish Community Study 97\n31 Olitzky, K.M., & Judson, D.

Currently, an applicant is ineligible only if he or she has been on an educational program\nfor more than three months.\n38 Based on data from the US Census Bureau’s Population Division County Characteristics Resident Population\nEstimates File, 2012-2016 vintage. The 2017 data were not available at the time of analysis.\n39 Twenty-seven percent of respondents specifically indicated that they preferred not to answer the income question\nand are excluded from this analysis. However, of respondents who did not answer the income question, 78% had at\nleast a bachelor’s degree, including 48% with one or more advanced degrees. Further, 89% indicated they were living at\nleast “reasonably comfortably,” including 6% who described themselves as “prosperous” and 34% who were living\n“very comfortably.” Eight percent described themselves as “just getting along.” Two percent said they were “nearly\npoor,” and 1% said they were “poor.”\n40 Based on data from the US Census Bureau’s Population Division County Characteristics Resident Population\nEstimates File, 2012-2016 vintage. The 2017 data were not available at the time of analysis.\n41 See, e.g., Price, M., & Herzenberg, S. (2017). The State of Working Pennsylvania 2017. Harrisburg, PA: Keystone\nResearch Center.\n42 For this and all subsequent tables in this chapter, two respondents with unusually large weights were removed from\nsubgroup analyses because they unduly skewed results. These respondents still contribute to the overall population\nanalyses.\n43 Respondents were asked whether they or anyone in their households experienced economic hardship in the past year\nbecause of changes in employment (e.g., job loss, reduction in pay, or returning to school), housing (e.g., receiving a\nforeclosure notice or a new mortgage), health (e.g., illness or medical emergency), or family structure (e.g., death of a\nrelative, divorce, or birth of a child)."
