It is the second-largest public transit agency in Pennsylvania and the 20th-largest in the United States.\n[\n3\n]\nPRT operates an integrated system of bus,\nlight rail\nand\nfunicular\nservices in\nPittsburgh\nand\nAllegheny County\n, with limited service to three adjacent counties in the Greater Pittsburgh region. The agency was founded in 1956 as the\nPort Authority of Allegheny County\n, and began operating transit service in 1964. PRT pioneered\nbus rapid transit\nin the United States with the opening of the South Busway in 1977, and continues to operate bus rapid transit services as a core part of its network. In 2024, the system had a ridership of 37,603,800.\nThe agency changed its public-facing brand to Pittsburgh Regional Transit in 2022, although it is still legally and commonly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County. The agency is constituted as a\nport authority\nunder Pennsylvania law, and is funded by state, local, and federal funds.\n[\n4\n]\nPRT is led by a professional CEO, who is overseen by a board of directors appointed by Allegheny County, the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and the Governor of Pennsylvania. PRT's customer service center and corporate headquarters are located in the\nHeinz 57 Center\nin Downtown Pittsburgh.\n[\n5\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nPittsburgh Regional Transit was created as the Port Authority of Allegheny County by the\nPennsylvania General Assembly\nin 1956 to allow for creation of port facilities in the Pittsburgh area and originally had the shortened name of PAT instead of PRT.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nThree years later, the legislation was amended to allow the Port Authority to acquire privately owned transit companies that served the area. This included the\nPittsburgh Railways Company\nand 32 independent bus and\nincline\noperations.\n[\n8\n]\nOn April 19, 1963, the Board of Allegheny County Commissioners authorized the acquisition of 32 transit companies, including the\nPittsburgh Railway Company\n, which had provided bus and streetcar service to\nPittsburgh\nsince January 1902, and an incline plane company, for about $12 million.\n[\n6\n]\nOn March 1, 1964, Port Authority Transit began service.\n[\n9\n]\nPort Authority light rail train, Washington Junction Station, March 2005\nShortly after the Port Authority began service, 150\nGM \"Fishbowl\"\nbuses were introduced to replace aging ones acquired from its predecessors, a new route numbering convention was introduced, and the fare system was streamlined.\n[\n9\n]\nDue to\nurban sprawl\n, the  agency introduced new routes that served new communities.\n[\n6\n]\nIn the following years, additional buses were ordered and several new transit garages opened.\n[\n9\n]\nMany of the trolley lines acquired from Pittsburgh Railways were abandoned, and turned into bus lines, with only the South Hills lines via Beechview and Overbrook retained.\n[\n10\n]\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Port Authority hoped to introduce a modern rapid transit system known as\nSkybus\nwith\nrubber-tired\nvehicles running on rails, but the plan fell through.\n[\n11\n]\nIn the early 1970s, the Port Authority entered what was dubbed by its fans the \"Mod\" era, with buses repainted in splashy paint schemes.\n[\n12\n]\nSeveral new flyer routes and routes to\nOakland's\nuniversity core were introduced as part of a new general\nmarketing\nstrategy.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 1975 the Port Authority took over the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad\ncommuter rail\nline to\nVersailles\n, which it branded\nPATrain\n.\n[\n13\n]\nThese new routes, coupled with the\n1973 oil crisis\n, generated a major increase in ridership.\n[\n12\n]\nDue to the\npoor state of the economy at the time\n, fares increased and there was a brief\nstrike\nin 1976.\n[\n14\n]\nIn spite of these setbacks, the\nSouth Busway\nopened in 1977 and plans for other capital investments were made.\n[\n6\n]\nDuring the 1980s, with gas prices falling and population loss from the\ndecline of the steel industry\n, ridership decreased and the agency lowered fares to attract new riders in the middle of the decade.\n[\n6\n]\nMany new buses were ordered, and the\nMartin Luther King Jr. East Busway\nopened in 1983.\n[\n15\n]\nAlso in the 1980s, construction began on the conversion of the remaining South Hills trolley lines to a modern light rail system.\n[\n6\n]\nA subway in Downtown Pittsburgh, a major component of the light rail system, opened in 1985. The Beechview line followed in 1987, and the\nLibrary line\na year later.\n[\n15\n]\nIn 1989, the agency celebrated its twenty-fifth year of existence, and commuter rail to Versailles was discontinued.\n[\n16\n]\nThe agency was rocked by a four-week strike due to a labor dispute in 1992.\n[\n14\n]\nThe strike, coupled with changing demographic patterns, caused a decrease in ridership.\n[\n6\n]\nNew buses that were compliant with the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990\nwere introduced early in the decade.\n[\n6\n]\nIn 1993, the badly deteriorated Overbrook light rail line was shut down, requiring trains to use the Beechview line.\n[\n17\n]\nSeveral capital projects, such as the construction of a western busway and light rail extensions were considered.\n[\n6\n]\nIn 1998, the agency rebranded itself as \"Ride Gold\" with new paint schemes and a new marketing campaign.\n[\n18\n]\nIn 2000, the\nWest Busway\nfrom the\nOhio River\nto\nCarnegie\nwas opened.\n[\n19\n]\nShortly thereafter, new bus routes to outlying communities such as\nCranberry\nwere established.\n[\n20\n]\nIn 2003, a short extension of the\nEast Busway\nwas completed.\n[\n21\n]\nThe following year, the Overbrook light rail line was re-opened after a lengthy reconstruction.\n[\n17\n]\nConstruction also started on a light rail extension to Pittsburgh's North Shore near\nHeinz Field\n, known as the\nNorth Shore Connector\n. In spite of the capital projects expansion, the agency was in serious financial trouble by the middle of the decade. In June 2007, the agency went through with a 15 percent service cut in order to cut the deficit.\n[\n22\n]\nIn order to provide a dedicated source of funding, Allegheny County Chief Executive\nDan Onorato\nintroduced the controversial 10%\nAllegheny County Alcoholic Beverage Tax\nin 2008 to fund the agency.\n[\n23\n]\nLater that same year, another strike was narrowly averted.\n[\n24\n]\nThe agency is planning a major service overhaul that will begin to go into effect in March 2010.\n[\n25\n]\nPittsburgh Regional Transit pays $168,763 annually to\nBuchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney\nand $48,750 annually to\nGreenlee Partners\nto lobby the\nPennsylvania General Assembly\n.\n[\n26\n]\nFunding crisis of 2010–12\n[\nedit\n]\nBetween 2007 and 2010, Pittsburgh Regional Transit cut its annual expenses by $52 million and raised its revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a statewide transportation funding crisis.\n[\n27\n]\nThe funding crisis only grew worse, however. The state legislature assumed it would receive permission to convert\nInterstate 80\ninto a toll road to increase revenues, but the federal government denied the request, leading to a gap in the state transportation budget of $472 million.\n[\n28\n]\nOn November 24, 2010, Pittsburgh Regional Transit's board of directors approved a massive service cut and fare hike to go into effect in March 2011, reducing service hours by approximately 35 percent, including the elimination of 45 routes.\n[\n27\n]\nPittsburgh Regional Transit's budget from the state was to be substantially reduced for 2011, and as chairperson Joan Ellenbogen noted, the PRT was legally required to adopt a balanced budget.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nTwenty nine routes were removed, thirty seven reduced, and a bus maintenance facility shut down. By 2013, the\nPennsylvania legislature\napproved Act 89, a dedicated transportation bill. Act 89 provided dedicated funding to Pittsburgh Regional Transit, which set the agency on more solid financial footing. One of the routes cut in 2011, the 55 Glassport, was restored in 2013.\n[\n32\n]\nThe Pittsburgh Regional Transit brand\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nSteel Plaza subway station.\nAlthough Pat Transit is part of the local fans' folklore, its off-beat imaging is more notorious. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s the bus fleet was very recognizable with its fleet of air-conditioned GM \"Fishbowls\" (from their 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1971 orders) sporting a white top with small red strip.\n[\n9\n]\nOther noticeable features included side destination signs placed near the exit door and an unusual seating arrangement with one side facing forward and the other lining up to match the seating placed on the wheel well.\n[\n9\n]\nPAT would continue ordering buses in that specification until 1995 when they ordered buses with both seating sides facing front except when on wheel wells. The side destination signs were moved immediately to the left of the front door starting with the 1998 Neoplan AN-460 (articulated bus) order. This continued with the Neoplan Metroliner order but skipped the Neoplan AN-440LF order in 1999. The 2003 order of Gillig Advantage low-floors and all subsequent orders have conformed with the side sign next to front door configuration. It is worth noting that the 1980 GM's RTS buses acquired were specified with the current side sign configuration.\nBy 1972 it entered what was dubbed by fans the \"Mod\" era, as buses were given flashy new paint schemes. Buses were painted with color at the front and rear, slanted to line up with the windows, and a large white portion in between.\n[\n12\n]\nIn the 1980s, the classic 1960s white and red strip look was updated with a larger red strip accompanied by a black strip painted around the window area, while a white background covered most of the bus exterior.\n[\n15\n]\nThis color scheme was in existence for roughly 20 years on the\nFlxible\nand\nNovaBus\n'classics' series, although these buses were later repainted and refurbished into the uniform color livery up until their retirements.\nIn 1998, PRT rebranded itself as \"Ride Gold\" to coincide with its 35th anniversary.\n[\n18\n]\nIn the early 2000s, Pittsburgh Regional Transit buses included various transportation-related words and phrases repeated across the exterior, such as the words \"move\", \"go\" \"ride\" or \"connect\", combinations of \"rockin'\" and \"rollin'\", \"ziggin'\" and \"zaggin'\", or \"here\" and \"there\".\n[\n33\n]\nOn September 21, 2006, the then-Port Authority announced that it was retiring the \"Ride Gold\" campaign and that the bus and light rail fleet will follow the standard design and uniform colors of its\nGillig\nbus fleet.\n[\n18\n]\nThe reason was the system's decision to return to a back-to-basics approach and to save costs on wholesale repainting and refurbishing. Their website began to use simple \"PORT AUTHORITY\" fonts, and some buses and light rail vehicles have been repainted with the standard \"Port Authority\" font.\nOn June 9, 2022,\n[\n34\n]\nat Gateway Station, it was announced that the Port Authority of Allegheny County was rebranding due to their name being a misnomer. It was said that the new name better represented who they are and how they were viewed.\n[\n35\n]\nFare structure\n[\nedit\n]\nOn April 29, 2016, following several months of public hearings, Pittsburgh Regional Transit's board of directors voted unanimously to implement sweeping changes to the fare system in 2017, including a decrease in fares for some riders for the first time in over 35 years.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nThe new fare system eliminated the current zone-based fare collection in favor of a flat $2.50 single-ride fare for all riders who pay via ConnectCard, and $2.75 for those who pay with cash. The first transfer to another line made within three hours costs $1.00. Beginning January 1, 2022, ConnectCard users paid $2.75 single-fare ride with a three-hour free transfer period. Cash users still pay $2.75 per ride.\n[\n38\n]\nRiders between Zones 1 and 2 used to pay a single-ride fare of $3.75, one of the highest intra-urban fares in the country. Although doing so was estimated to lose $4 million in revenue for the agency, the 25-cent cash surcharge aims to recoup at least some of the losses, along with eliminating paper transfer tickets for cash fares and establishing a $2 surcharge for new or replacement ConnectCard purchases. These changes are also intended to discourage paying fares with cash in favor of increased ConnectCard use, which the agency also says will speed up trip times.\n[\n39\n]\nSeniors 65 years and older and up to three children below 6 ride for free with a fare-paying rider; disabled and\nMedicare\nusers, as well as children ages 6 to 11, pay either $1.35 in cash or $1.25 with ConnectCard, and $0.50 for transfers.\nThe agency also voted to abolish the \"pay enter/pay leave\" fare collection policy in favor of all riders simply paying their fare upon entering the bus regardless of destination, similar to the method used on most other American transit agencies.  This change eliminated the free fare zone in downtown Pittsburgh, excluding rides on the \"T\" between Downtown and the North Shore which remain accessible for no charge. The agency also eventually plans to implement a\nproof of payment\nsystem, with riders required to scan their ConnectCards at kiosks on station platforms prior to boarding and Pittsburgh Regional Transit fare officers performing random inspections on board to ensure payment.\n[\n37\n]\nPrevious fare system\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section needs to be\nupdated\n.\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n(\nOctober 2019\n)\nPittsburgh Regional Transit used a fare structure based on four main zones (1, 1A, and 2). The downtown area was an unnumbered\nFree Fare Zone\n,  established in 1985 to encourage transit use in downtown and reduce stop \"dwell\" times (the amount of time a transit vehicle must remain stopped for passengers to board or alight).  All rides within the downtown zone are free, at all times on the\nlight rail\nsystem (called the \"T\") and until 7 p.m. on buses, seven days a week.\n[\n40\n]\nOriginally the free-fare zone applied only until 7 p.m. on both buses and light rail, but it was expanded to 24 hours on the latter in 1989. Zone 1 was the zone closest to downtown Pittsburgh, and Zone 2 comprised the outer half of Allegheny County and all stops outside of Allegheny County. A few routes cross briefly into neighboring counties.\nThe system used an\n\"outbound\" pay system\nfor daytime transit to and from downtown. Fare was paid when boarding on the \"outbound\" part of the route.\n[\n41\n]\nThis applies only on buses that serve downtown; on most that do not serve downtown, the rider pays upon entry.\n[\n41\n]\nDuring the evening, on buses serving downtown, the method changes on many routes to \"pay when boarding\" (also known as \"pay enter\"), due to the possibility of riders\ntrying to avoid paying the fare\n. In combination with the downtown\nFree Fare Zone\n, this fare collection system permits boarding to take place via all doors in downtown (except evenings), greatly reducing loading delays in the part of the system with the heaviest concentration of transit routes and passenger boarding per stop.\n[\n42\n]\nPittsburgh Regional Transit sells non-discounted single-use tickets, and discounted weekly, monthly and annual passes.\n[\n43\n]\nEach carries a small discount over earlier time-based passes and is valid for an unlimited number of trips/transfers in the specified zone(s) for that time period. For example, for a zone 1 pass the cost of a weekly is the equivalent of 9.5 one-way trips, a monthly is equivalent to 34 trips, and an annual is equivalent to 377 trips. An annual pass is a 12-month subscription to monthly passes, which can be either mailed or picked up at the Downtown Service Center on Smithfield Street.\nStudents and staff of several colleges in the area, most notably\nCarnegie Mellon University\nand the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n, ride the bus for free: students pay a fee each semester to the PRT.\n[\n44\n]\nPittsburgh Regional Transit installed new fareboxes on all buses in 2011,\n[\n45\n]\nand has converted to a smart card fare collection system marketed as the \"ConnectCard\"\n[\n46\n]\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\nstarting in early 2012.\n[\n45\n]\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University use the new farebox system by equipping their ID cards with a chip the farebox can scan and recognize. Because individuals affiliated with the Universities ride for \"free,\" the system serves only to authenticate the validity of the ID card, and no fares are calculated or assessed.\nLight rail\n[\nedit\n]\nThe logo for Pittsburgh's subway and light rail system\nMain article:\nPittsburgh Light Rail\nPittsburgh Regional Transit operates a 26-mile (42 km) light rail system called the \"T\" from downtown subway stations to neighborhoods and suburbs south of the city on surface tracks with right-of-way.\nThe system comprises three lines, all of which have a northern terminus at\nAllegheny station\non\nPittsburgh's North Shore\nnear\nAcrisure Stadium\nand the\nCarnegie Science Center\n:\nThe\nRed Line\n, which runs through\nBeechview\n,\nDormont\n,\nMt. Lebanon\n,\nCastle Shannon\nand\nBethel Park\nbefore terminating at\nSouth Hills Village\nThe\nBlue Line\n, which runs through\nKnoxville\n,\nOverbrook\n, Castle Shannon and Bethel Park before terminating at South Hills Village\nThe\nSilver Line\n, which runs through\nKnoxville\n,\nOverbrook\n, Castle Shannon, Bethel Park and\nSouth Park\nbefore terminating at\nLibrary\nFuniculars\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nMonongahela Incline\nand\nDuquesne Incline\nPittsburgh's mass transit system also includes two unique\nfuniculars\n(called \"inclines\" locally) from the top of\nMt. Washington\nto its base along the Monongahela River, just across from Downtown Pittsburgh. In 2024, the two inclines had a combined ridership of 904,300.\n[\n1\n]\nBoth the\nDuquesne Incline\nand the\nMonongahela Incline\nhave stations along Grandview Avenue atop Mt Washington and in the\nStation Square\narea at the base.\nThe Duquesne Incline is owned by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, and The Society for the Preservation of the Duquesne Heights Incline operates it as a non-profit organization. It has the original cars and the original stations.\nBuses\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of bus routes in Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh Regional Transit operates 700 buses, as of April 2014, in\nAllegheny County\n, and also service extends slightly into neighboring\nBeaver\n,\nButler\n,\nWashington\nand\nWestmoreland\ncounties. Some bus routes operate seven days a week between 4:00 am and 2:00 am, but many routes have more restricted hours, or do not operate on weekends, or on Sundays and holidays.\nIn May 2001 the fleet installed its first bike racks, with all of its fleet being equipped with bike racks by 2011.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nBus rapid transit\n[\nedit\n]\nHerron station\non the East Busway\nMain articles:\nSouth Busway\n,\nMartin Luther King Jr. East Busway\n, and\nWest Busway\nIn December 1977, the Port Authority unveiled its first dedicated\nbusway\n, the 4.3-mile\nSouth Busway\n, which combined bus and light rail routes into an efficient and quicker connection between downtown Pittsburgh and the South Hills area. The\nMartin Luther King Jr. East Busway\n, which used express routes to connect downtown with nearby east side communities like\nSwissvale\n,\nWilkinsburg\nand\nHomewood\nfollowed in February 1983. On Sunday, September 10, 2000, Port Authority opened its\nWest Busway\n, which provides service from downtown\nPittsburgh\nto\nCarnegie\n. In 2003, the East Busway was expanded by a few miles to Swissvale and\nRankin\n.\nOn July 22, 2011, the Port Authority approved spending at least $1 million, including $837,993 in federal funding and $209,498 in county money, to study developing a\nrapid bus line\nfrom Downtown to the Oakland section. The study was projected to take 18 months and use no money from Pittsburgh Regional Transit's operating budget.\n[\n51\n]\nThe study resulted in planning for the new\nUniversity Line\nwhich began construction in 2022. Rerouting existing bus routes and implementing other system changes began in October 2023.\n[\n52\n]\nOther services\n[\nedit\n]\nPittsburgh Regional Transit operates more than 60\npark-and-ride\nlots in\nAllegheny County\n. It owns 66 transit bridges, 11 highway bridges and four tunnels.\n[\n53\n]\nUnder the PRT-sponsored ACCESS program, a private contractor provides door-to-door service to elderly and disabled passengers throughout the county, seven days a week from 6 a.m. to midnight.  Reservations are placed one day in advance.  The ACCESS program is noted as one of the first, most innovative and best in the nation.\n[\n54\n]\nBetween 2001 and 2004 the Port Authority worked with the local community group Ground Zero to create and operate the \"Ultra Violet Loop\"; known to some as the \"party bus\", the UV Loop bus was special service operated on Friday and Saturday nights through the early morning, serving city nightlife and university centers.\n[\n55\n]\nThe UV Loop bus was part of special evaluative service supported in part by local foundations and businesses.  While it was well regarded in the abstract, it never achieved the ridership and consistent service needed to continue without external support.  The \"Ultra Violet Loop\" name is a play on the\nPittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System\n.\n[\n56\n]\nFuture\n[\nedit\n]\nPotential capital expansions\n[\nedit\n]\nSeveral capital expansions have been proposed from various sources. The construction of a light rail line from Oakland to\nPittsburgh International Airport\nhas been proposed by County Executive Dan Onorato and former\nCongressman\nMike Doyle\n, projected to cost about $3.5 billion.\n[\n57\n]\nDoyle submitted a request to the Federal government to study the feasibility of the project.\nCurrent finances\n[\nedit\n]\nSince 2007, Pittsburgh Regional Transit cut annual expenses by $52 million and raised revenues by $14 million to help alleviate a $472 million gap in the state transportation budget.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nIn late 2010, the PRT's board approved service cuts of 35% (45 routes) and fare increases.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nThe Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission approved a plan by Governor\nEd Rendell\nto allocate $45 million for the Authority to help reduce service cuts to only 15% on March 27, 2011.\n[\n58\n]\n[\n59\n]\nSince Governor\nTom Corbett\n's 2012 budget, Pittsburgh Regional Transit has renewed plans to cut service by 35% if the state fails to help with a projected $64 million budget deficit.\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nPort Authority Police Department\nList of rapid transit systems\nPaul Skoutelas\nDennis Veraldi\nSEPTA\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\n\"Transit Ridership Report Fourth Quarter 2024\"\n(PDF)\n.\nAmerican Public Transportation Association\n.
