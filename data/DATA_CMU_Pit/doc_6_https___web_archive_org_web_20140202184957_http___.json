The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United\nStates\nRaj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez\nNBER Working Paper No. 19843\nJanuary 2014\nJEL No. H0,J0\nABSTRACT\nWe use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to\ndescribe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the\njoint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child\nincome given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent\nincome is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility\nvaries substantially across areas within the U.S. For example, the probability that a child reaches the\ntop quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4%\nin Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility.\nHigh mobility areas have (1) less residential segregation, (2) less income inequality, (3) better primary\nschools, (4) greater social capital, and (5) greater family stability. While our descriptive analysis does\nnot identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the new publicly available statistics\non intergenerational mobility by area developed here can facilitate future research on such mechanisms.\nRaj Chetty Patrick Kline\nDepartment of Economics Department of Economics\nHarvard University UC, Berkeley\n1805 Cambridge St. 508-1 Evans Hall #3880\nCambridge, MA 02138 Berkeley, CA 94720\nand NBER and NBER\nchetty@fas.harvard.edu pkline@econ.berkeley.edu\nNathaniel Hendren Emmanuel Saez\nHarvard University Department of Economics\nDepartment of Economics University of California, Berkeley\nLittauer Center Room 235 530 Evans Hall #3880\nCambridge, MA 02138 Berkeley, CA 94720\nand NBER and NBER\nnhendren@gmail.com saez@econ.berkeley.eduI Introduction\nThe United States is often hailed as the “land of opportunity,” a society in which a child’s chances\nof success depend little on her family background. Is this reputation warranted? We show that this\nquestion does not have a clear answer because there is substantial variation in intergenerational\nmobility across areas within the U.S. The U.S. is better described as a collection of societies, some\nof which are “lands of opportunity” with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in\nwhich few children escape poverty.\nWe characterize intergenerational mobility using information from de-identified federal income\ntax records, which provide data on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents\nbetween 1996 and 2012. We organize our analysis into three parts. In the first section, we present\nnew statistics on intergenerational mobility in the U.S. as a whole. In our baseline analysis, we\nfocus on current U.S. citizens in the 1980-1982 birth cohorts – the oldest children in our data for\nwhom we can reliably identify parents based on information on dependent claiming. We measure\nthesechildren’sincomeasmeantotalfamilyincomein2011and2012,whentheyareapproximately\n30 years old. We measure their parents’ income as mean family income between 1996 and 2000,\nwhen the children are between the ages of 15 and 20.\nTheliteraturehasidentifiedtwoeconometricchallengesinestimatingintergenerationalmobility:\nlifecycle bias due to measuring income at early or late ages and attenuation bias due to noise in\nannual measures of income (e.g., Solon 1992, Zimmerman 1992, Mazumder 2005). We show that\nestimates of intergenerational mobility stabilize when children reach their late twenties. Estimates\nof mobility are insensitive to the age of parents and children at which parent income is measured,\nprovided that parent income is measured between age 30 and 55. We also show that using several\nyears of data to measure parent and child income does not substantially increase estimates of\nmobility, perhaps because transitory measurement error is less prevalent in tax records than survey\ndata. These results indicate that our baseline income definitions do not suffer from significant\nlifecycle or attenuation bias.\nWe begin our characterization of intergenerational mobility by regressing log child income on\nlog parent income, as in prior work. This specification yields an intergenerational elasticity (IGE)\nestimate of 0.344, similar to Solon’s (1992) preferred estimates based on survey data. Although the\nlog-log specification has desirable theoretical properties (Solon 2004), it suffers from two empirical\nshortcomings. First, it omits observations with zero income. Since children of low income parents\n1are much more likely to have zero income, dropping these observations overstates mobility. Second,\nthe relationship between log child income and log parent income is highly non-linear, with much\nlower local IGEs below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile. These issues limit the\nsuitability of the log-log specification for cross-area comparisons, as IGE estimates are sensitive to\ndifferences in local income distributions.\nTo address these problems, we develop a rank-rank specification similar to that used by Dahl\nand DeLeire (2008). We rank children based on their incomes relative to other children in the\nsame birth cohort, including those with zero income. We rank parents of these children based\non their incomes relative to other parents with children in these birth cohorts. The relationship\nbetween mean child ranks and parent ranks is almost perfectly linear. The slope of the rank-rank\nrelationship is 0.341, i.e. a 10 percentile point increase in parent rank is associated with a 3.41\npercentile increase in a child’s income rank. Children’s college attendance and teenage birth rates\nare also linearly related to parent income ranks. A 10 percentile point increase in parent income is\nassociatedwitha6.7percentagepoint(pp)increaseincollegeattendanceratesanda3ppreduction\nin teenage birth rates for women.\nIn the second part of the paper, we use the rank-rank specification to characterize variation\nin intergenerational mobility across commuting zones (CZs). Commuting zones are geographical\naggregations of counties that are similar to metro areas but cover the entire U.S., including rural\nareas (Tolbert and Sizer 1996). We assign children to commuting zones based on where they lived\nat age 16 – i.e., where they grew up – irrespective of whether they left that CZ afterward. When\nanalyzing CZs, we continue to rank both children and parents based on their positions in the\nnational income distribution, allowing us to measure children’s absolute outcomes as we discuss\nbelow.\nThe relationship between mean child ranks and parent ranks remains almost perfectly linear\nwithin commuting zones, allowing us to summarize the conditional expectation of a child’s rank\ngivenhisparents’rankwithjusttwoparameters: aslopeandintercept. Theslopemeasuresrelative\nmobility: the difference in outcomes between children from top vs. bottom income families within\na CZ. The intercept measures the expected rank for children from families at the bottom of the\nincome distribution. Combining the intercept and slope for a CZ, we can calculate the expected\nrank of children from families at any given percentile p of the national parent income distribution.\nWe term this measure absolute mobility at percentile p. Measuring absolute mobility is valuable\nbecause increases in relative mobility have ambiguous normative implications, as they may be\n2driven by worse outcomes for the rich rather than better outcomes for the poor.\nWe find substantial variation in both relative and absolute mobility across CZs. Relative mo-\nbility is lowest for children who grew up in the Southeast and highest in the Mountain West and\nthe rural Midwest.1 Some CZs in the U.S. have relative mobility comparable to the highest mo-\nbility countries in the world, such as Denmark, while others have lower levels of mobility than any\ndeveloped country for which data are available.\nWe find similar geographical variation in absolute mobility. We focus much of our analysis on\nabsolute mobility at p = 25, which we term “absolute upward mobility.” This statistic measures\nthe mean income rank of children with parents in the bottom half of the income distribution given\nlinearity of the rank-rank relationship. Absolute upward mobility ranges from 35.8 in Charlotte to\n46.2 in Salt Lake City among the 50 largest CZs. Overall, a 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in\nCZ-level upward mobility is associated with a 0.2 SD improvement in a child’s expected rank given\nparents at p = 25, 60% as large as the effect of a 1 SD increase in her own parents’ income. Other\nmeasures of upward mobility exhibit similar spatial variation. For instance, the probability that a\nchild reaches the top fifth of the income distribution conditional on having parents in the bottom\nfifth is 4.4% in Charlotte, compared with 10.8% in Salt Lake City and 12.9% in San Jose. The\nCZ-level mobility statistics are also robust to adjusting for differences in the local cost-of-living,\nshocks to local growth, and using alternative measures of income.\nAbsolute upward mobility is highly correlated with relative mobility: areas with high levels of\nrelative mobility (low rank-rank slopes) tend to have better outcomes for children from low-income\nfamilies. On average, children from families below percentile p = 85 have better outcomes when\nrelative mobility is greater; those above p = 85 have worse outcomes. An important consequence of\nthis result is that location matters most for children from low income families: the expected rank of\nchildren from low-income families varies more across CZs than the expected rank of children from\nhigh income families.\nThe spatial patterns of the gradients of college attendance and teenage birth rates with respect\nto parent income across CZs are very similar to the pattern in intergenerational income mobility.\nThe fact that much of the spatial variation in children’s outcomes emerges before they enter the\nlabor market suggests that the differences in mobility are driven by factors that affect children\nwhile they are growing up.\n1The fact that we define location based on where children grew up is important here. Successful children who\ngrow up in rural areas often work in a different CZ (e.g., a nearby city) as adults.\n3In the final part of the paper, we explore such factors by correlating the spatial variation in\nmobility with observable characteristics. We begin by showing that upward income mobility is\nsignificantly lower in areas with larger African-American populations. However, white individuals\ninareaswithlargeAfrican-Americanpopulationsalsohavelowerratesofupwardmobility,implying\nthat racial shares matter at the community (rather than individual) level. One mechanism for such\nacommunity-leveleffectofraceissegregation. Areaswithlargerblackpopulationstendtobemore\nsegregated by income and race, which could affect both white and black low-income individuals\nadversely. Indeed, we find a strong negative correlation between standard measures of racial and\nincome segregation and upward mobility. Moreover, we also find that upward mobility is higher in\ncities with less sprawl, as measured by commute times to work. These findings lead us to identify\nsegregation as the first of five broad factors that are strongly correlated with mobility.\nThe second factor we explore is inequality. CZs with larger Gini coefficients have less upward\nmobility, consistent with the “Great Gatsby curve” documented across countries (Krueger 2012,\nCorak 2013). In contrast, top 1% income shares are not highly correlated with intergenerational\nmobilitybothacrossCZswithintheU.S.andacrosscountries. Althoughonecannotdrawdefinitive\nconclusionsfromsuchcorrelations,theysuggestthatthefactorsthaterodethemiddleclasshamper\nintergenerational mobility more than the factors that lead to income growth in the upper tail.\nThird, proxies for the quality of the K-12 school system are also correlated with mobility. Areas\nwith higher test scores (controlling for income levels), lower dropout rates, and smaller class sizes\nhave higher rates of upward mobility. In addition, areas with higher local tax rates, which are\npredominantly used to finance public schools, have higher rates of mobility.\nFourth, social capital indices (Putnam 1995) – which are proxies for the strength of social\nnetworks and community involvement in an area – are very strongly correlated with mobility. For\ninstance, high upward mobility areas tend to have higher fractions of religious individuals and\ngreater participation in local civic organizations.\nFinally, the strongest predictors of upward mobility are measures of family structure such as\nthe fraction of single parents in the area. As with race, parents’ marital status does not matter\npurely through its effects at the individual level. Children of married parents also have higher rates\nof upward mobility if they live in communities with fewer single parents.\nWefindmodestcorrelationsbetweenupwardmobilityandlocaltaxandgovernmentexpenditure\npolicies and no systematic correlation between mobility and local labor market conditions, rates of\nmigration, or access to higher education. In a multiple regression, the five key factors described\n4above generally remain statistically significant predictors of both relative and absolute upward\nmobility, even in specifications with state fixed effects. However, we emphasize that these factors\nshould not be interpreted as causal determinants of mobility because all of these variables are\nendogenous and our analysis does not control for numerous other unobserved differences across\nareas.\nOur results build on and contribute to an extensive empirical literature on intergenerational\nmobility, reviewed by Solon (1999), Grawe and Mulligan (2002), and Black and Devereux (2011).\nSeveral studies have compared mobility across countries using a log-log specification and have\nfound that relative mobility is lower in the U.S. than in other developed countries (e.g., Bjorklund\nand J¨antti 1997, J¨antti et al. 2006, Corak 2013). Our estimates of the IGE in the U.S. as a\nwhole are similar to those found in prior work, with the exception of Mazumder’s (2005) widely\ncited estimates, which imply much lower levels of intergenerational mobility than we find here for\nreasons we explain in Online Appendix C. Our analysis is most closely related to contemporaneous\nwork by Graham and Sharkey (2013), who use survey data to estimate relative mobility using\nlog-log specifications in a subset of cities in the U.S. Their estimates are correlated with ours, but\ndo not permit an assessment of absolute mobility and are naturally less precise due to limitations\nin sample size.\nOur approach of within-country comparisons offers two advantages over the cross-country com-\nparisons that have been the focus of prior comparative work. First, differences in measurement and\neconometric methods make it difficult to reach definitive conclusions from cross-country compar-\nisons (Solon 2002, Black and Devereux 2011). The income measures and covariates we analyze here\nare all measured using the same data sources across all CZs. Second, and more importantly, we can\ncharacterizebothrelativeandabsolutemobilityacrossCZsbyusingnationalrankstomeasurechil-\ndren’s outcomes. The cross-country literature has focused on differences in relative mobility, partly\nbecause it is difficult to compare the absolute standard of living across very different economies.\nAlthough the literature on cross-country differences in economic growth has characterized differ-\nencesinmeanabsolutelivingstandardsacrossnations, muchlessisknownabouthowtheprospects\nof children from low-income families vary across countries when measured on a common absolute\nscale (Ray 2010).\nOuranalysisalsorelatestotheliteratureonneighborhoodeffects,reviewedbyJencksandMayer\n(1990)andSampsonetal.(2002). Manyofthecorrelationsweexplorearemotivatedbyhypotheses\nproposed in this literature, such as the impacts of concentrated poverty (Wilson 1987), residential\n5segregation (Massey and Denton 1993, Cutler and Glaeser 1997), social capital (Coleman 1988,\nPutnam 1995), and local school quality (Card and Krueger 1992). However, unlike recent exper-\nimental and quasi-experimental work on neighborhood effects (e.g., Katz et al. 2001, Oreopoulos\n2003), our descriptive analysis does not shed light on whether the differences in outcomes across\nareas are due to the causal effect of neighborhoods or differences in the characteristics of people\nliving in those neighborhoods.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the data. Section III\nreports estimates of intergenerational mobility at the national level. In Section IV, we present\nestimates of absolute and relative mobility by commuting zone. Section V reports correlations of\nour mobility measures with observable characteristics of commuting zones. Section VI concludes.\nStatistics on intergenerational mobility and related covariates are publicly available by commuting\nzone, metropolitan statistical area, and county on the project website.\nII Data\nWe use data from federal income tax records spanning 1996-2012. The data include both income\ntax returns (1040 forms) and third-party information returns (e.g., W-2 forms), which give us\ninformation on the earnings of those who do not file tax returns. We provide a detailed description\nof how we construct our analysis sample starting from the raw population data in Online Appendix\nA. Here, we briefly summarize the key variable and sample definitions. Note that in what follows,\nthe year always refers to the tax year (i.e., the calendar year in which the income is earned).\nII.A Sample Definitions\nOur base dataset of children consists of all individuals who (1) have a valid Social Security Number\nor Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, (2) were born between 1980-1991, and (3) are U.S.\ncitizens as of 2013. We impose the citizenship requirement to exclude individuals who are likely to\nhave immigrated to the U.S. as adults, for whom we cannot measure parent income. We cannot\ndirectlyrestrictthesampletoindividualsbornintheU.S.becausethedatabaseonlyrecordscurrent\ncitizenship status.\nWe identify the parents of a child as the first tax filers (between 1996-2012) who claim the child\nasachilddependentandwerebetweentheagesof15and40whenthechildwasborn. Ifthechildis\nfirst claimed by a single filer, the child is defined as having a single parent. For simplicity, we assign\neach child a parent (or parents) permanently using this algorithm, regardless of any subsequent\n6changes in parents’ marital status or dependent claiming.2\nIf parents never file a tax return, we cannotlink them totheir child. Although some low-income\nindividuals do not file tax returns in a given year, almost all parents file a tax return at some point\nbetween 1996 and 2012 to obtain a tax refund on their withheld taxes and the Earned Income\nTax Credit (Cilke 1998). As a result, we are able to identify parents for approximately 95% of\nthe children in the 1980-1991 birth cohorts.3 Because we have more opportunities to link younger\nchildren to their parents, the fraction of children linked to parents rises from approximately 90%\nfor the early birth cohorts to nearly 99% for the most recent birth cohorts (Online Appendix Table\nI).4 The fraction of children linked to parents drops sharply prior to the 1980 birth cohort because\nour data begin in 1996 and many children begin to the leave the household starting at age 17. This\nis why we limit our analysis to children born during or after 1980.\nOur primary analysis sample, which we refer to as the core sample, includes all children in the\nbase dataset who (1) are born in the 1980-82 birth cohorts, (2) for whom we are able to identify\nparents, and (3) whose mean parent income between 1996-2000 is strictly positive (which excludes\n1.2%ofchildren).5 Forsomerobustnesschecks,weusetheextendedsample,whichimposesthesame\nrestrictions as the core sample, but includes all birth cohorts 1980-1991. There are approximately\n10 million children in the core sample and 44 million children in the extended sample.\nStatistics of Income Sample. Because we can only reliably link children to parents starting\nwith the 1980 birth cohort in the population tax data, we can only measure earnings of children\nup to age 32 (in 2012) in the full sample. To evaluate whether estimates of intergenerational\nmobility would change significantly if earnings were measured at later ages, we supplement our\nanalysis using annual cross-sections of tax returns maintained by the Statistics of Income (SOI)\ndivisionoftheInternalRevenueServicepriorto1996. TheSOIcross-sectionsprovideidentifiersfor\ndependents claimed on tax forms starting in 1987, allowing us to link parents to children back to\nthe 1971 birth cohort using an algorithm analogous to that described above (see Online Appendix\n212% of children in our core sample are claimed as dependents by different individuals in subsequent years. To\nensurethatthispotentialmeasurementerrorinlinkingchildrentoparentsdoesnotaffectourfindings,weshowthat\nwe obtain similar estimates of mobility for the subset of children who are never claimed by other individuals (row 9\nof Table V).\n3Chettyetal.(2013)presentfurtherevidencethatonecanidentifyparentsforvirtuallyallchildrenwhogrewup\nin the U.S. by showing that 98% of children enrolled in a large school district in grades 3-8 can be linked to parents\nin the tax data.\n4To ensure that our results are not biased by the missing data in the early cohorts, we also replicate our analysis\nrestricting the sample to more recent birth cohorts (see rows 5 and 6 of Table V).\n5We limit the sample to parents with positive income because parents who file a tax return (as required to link\nthem to a child) yet have zero income are unlikely to be representative of individuals with zero income and those\nwith negative income typically have large capital losses, which are a proxy for having significant wealth.\n7A for further details). The SOI cross-sections are stratified random samples of tax returns with\na sampling probability that rises with income; using sampling weights, we can calculate statistics\nrepresentative of the national distribution. After linking parents to children in the SOI sample,\nwe use population tax data to obtain data on income for children and parents, using the same\ndefinitions as in the core sample. There are approximately 63,000 children in the 1971-79 birth\ncohorts in the SOI sample (Online Appendix Table II).\nII.B Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics\nIn this section, we define the key variables we use to measure intergenerational mobility. We\nmeasure all monetary variables in 2012 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the consumer price\nindex (CPI-U).\nParent Income. Following Lee and Solon (2009), our primary measure of parent income is total\npre-taxincomeatthehouseholdlevel,whichwelabel parent family income. Moreprecisely,inyears\nwhereaparentfilesataxreturn, wedefinefamilyincomeasAdjustedGrossIncome(asreportedon\nthe1040taxreturn)plustax-exemptinterestincomeandthenon-taxableportionofSocialSecurity\nand Disability benefits. In years where a parent does not file a tax return, we define family income\nas the sum of wage earnings (reported on form W-2), unemployment benefits (reported on form\n1099-G), and gross social security and disability benefits (reported on form SSA-1099) for both\nparents.6 In years where parents have no tax return and no information returns, family income is\ncoded as zero.\nNote that this income measure includes labor earnings and capital income as well as unem-\nployment insurance, social security, and disability benefits. It excludes non-taxable cash transfers\nsuch as TANF and SSI, in-kind benefits such as food stamps, all refundable tax credits such as\nthe EITC, non-taxable pension contributions (e.g., to 401(k)’s), and any earned income not re-\nported to the IRS. Income is always measured prior to the deduction of individual income taxes\nand employee-level payroll taxes.\nInourbaselineanalysis, weaverageparents’familyincomeoverthefiveyearsfrom1996to2000\nto reduce noise due to transitory fluctuations (Solon 1992). We use the earliest years in our sample\nto best reflect the economic resources of parents while the children in our sample are growing up.7\n6ThedatabasedoesnotrecordW-2’sandotherinformationreturnspriorto1999,sonon-filer’sincomeiscodedas\n0priorto1999. WeverifythatthisisnotanimportantsourceofbiasbyshowinginTableV(row18)thatweobtain\nvery similar results when defining parent income only using post-1999 data. We cannot observe self-employment\nincome for non-filers and therefore code it as zero; given the strong incentives for individuals with children to file\ncreated by the EITC, most non-filers likely have very low levels of self-employment income.\n7Formally, we define mean family income as the mother’s family income plus the father’s family income in each\n8We evaluate the robustness of our findings using a measure of individual parent income instead\nof family income. For single parents, parent family income coincides with individual income. For\nmarried parents, we define each parent’s individual earnings as the sum of wage earnings from\nform W-2, unemployment benefits from form 1099-G, and Social Security and Disability benefits\nfrom form SSA-1099 for that individual. Individual earnings excludes capital and other non-labor\nincome. Toincorporatethesesourcesofincome,weaddhalfoffamilynon-laborincome–definedas\ntotal family income minus total family earnings reported on form 1040 – to each parent’s individual\nearnings. We divide non-labor earnings equally between spouses because we cannot identify which\nspouse earns non-labor income from the 1040 tax return.\nChild Income. We define child family income in exactly the same way as parent family income.\nInourbaselineanalysis,weaveragechildfamilyincomeoverthelasttwoyearsinourdata(2011and\n2012). We use the most recent two years because the children in our sample are all born after 1980,\nand income in the early 30’s provides a better measure of lifetime income than income at earlier\nages (Haider and Solon 2006). We report results using alternative years to assess the sensitivity of\nour findings. For children, we define household income based on current marital status rather than\nmarital status at a fixed point in time. Because family income varies with marital status, we also\nreport results using individual income measures for children, constructed in exactly the same way\nas for parents.\nCollege Attendance. Wedefinecollegeattendanceasanindicatorforhavingoneormore1098-T\nformsfiledonone’sbehalfwhentheindividualisaged18-21. TitleIVinstitutions–allcollegesand\nuniversities as well as vocational schools and other post-secondary institutions eligible for federal\nstudentaid–arerequiredtofile1098-Tformsthatreporttuitionpaymentsorscholarshipsreceived\nfor every student. Because the 1098-T forms are filed directly by colleges independent of whether\nan individual files a tax return, we have complete records on college attendance for all children.\nThe 1098-T data are available from 1999-2012. Comparisons to other data sources indicate that\n1098-T forms capture college enrollment quite accurately overall (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff\n2013, Section 3.1).8\nyear from 1996 to 2000 divided by 10 (or divided by 5 if we only identify a single parent). For parents who do\nnot change marital status, this is simply mean family income over the 5 year period. For parents who are married\ninitially and then divorce, this measure tracks the mean family incomes of the two divorced parents over time. For\nparents who are single initially and then get married, this measure tracks individual income prior to marriage and\ntotalfamilyincome(includingthenewspouse’sincome)aftermarriage. Thesehouseholdmeasuresofincomeincrease\nwith marriage and naturally do not account for cohabitation; to ensure that these features do not generate bias, we\nassess the robustness of our results to using individual measures of income.\n8Colleges are not required to file 1098-T forms for students whose qualified tuition and related expenses are\nwaived or paid entirely with scholarships or grants. However, the forms are frequently available even for such cases,\n9Teenage Birth. We define a woman as having a teenage birth if she ever claims a dependent\nwho was born while she was between the ages of 13 and 19. This measure is an imperfect proxy\nfor having a teenage birth because it only covers children who are claimed as dependents by their\nmothers. Fortunately, the aggregate level and spatial pattern of teenage births in our data are\nclosely aligned with estimates based on the American Community Survey.9\nSummary Statistics. Table I reports summary statistics for the core sample. Median parent\nfamily income is $60,129 (in 2012 dollars). Among the 30.6% of children matched to single parents,\n72.0% are matched to a female parent. Children in our core sample have a median family income\nof $34,975 when they are approximately 30 years old. 6.1% of children have zero income in both\n2011 and 2012. 58.9% are enrolled in a college at some point between the ages of 18 and 21 and\n15.9% of women have a teenage birth.\nIn Online Appendix Table III, we show that the total cohort size, labor force participation\nrate, distribution of child income, and other demographic characteristics of our core sample line up\nclosely with corresponding estimates in the Current Population Survey and American Community\nSurvey. Thisconfirmsthatoursamplecoversroughlythesamenationallyrepresentativepopulation\nas previous survey-based research.\nIII National Statistics\nWebeginourempiricalanalysisbycharacterizingtherelationshipbetweenparentandchildincome\natthenationallevel. Wefirstpresentasetofbaselineestimatesofintergenerationalincomemobility\nand then evaluate the robustness of our estimates to alternative sample and income definitions.\nIII.A Baseline Estimates\nIn our baseline analysis, we use the core sample (1980-82 birth cohorts) and measure parent income\nas mean family income from 1996-2000 and child income as mean family income in 2011-12, when\nchildren are approximately 30 years old. Figure Ia presents a binned scatter plot of the mean\nfamily income of children versus the mean family income of their parents. To construct this figure,\nwe divide the x axis into 100 equal-sized (percentile) bins and plot mean child income vs. mean\npresumably because of automated reporting to the IRS by universities. Approximately 6% of 1098-T forms are\nmissing from 2000-2003 because the database contains no 1098-T forms for some small colleges in these years. To\nverify that this does not affect our results, we confirm that our estimates of college attendance by parent income\ngradients are very similar for later birth cohorts (not reported).\n915.8% of women in our core sample have teenage births; the corresponding number is 14.6% in the 2003 ACS.\nThe unweighted correlation between state-level teenage birth rates in the tax data and the ACS is 0.80.\n10parent income in each bin. For scaling purposes, we exclude the top bin (children of parents in\nthe top 1%) in this figure only. This binned scatter plot provides a non-parametric representation\nof the conditional expectation of child income given parent income. The regression coefficients\nand standard errors reported in this and all subsequent binned scatter plots are estimated on the\nunderlying microdata using OLS regressions.\nThe conditional expectation of children’s income given parents’ income is strongly concave.\nBelow the 90th percentile of parent income, a $1 increase in parent family income is associated\nwith a 33.5 cent increase in average child family income. In contrast, between the 90th and 99th\npercentile, a$1increaseinparentincomeisassociatedwithonlya7.6centincreaseinchildincome.\nPartlymotivatedbythisnon-linearity,muchoftheempiricalliteraturehasestimatedregressions\noflogchildincomeonlogparentincome. Theslopeofthisregressionmeasurestheelasticityofchild\nincome with respect to parent income, commonly termed the intergenerational income elasticity\n(IGE). We implement this specification in the first column of row 1 of Table II, excluding children\nwith zero income as in prior work. We obtain an IGE estimate of 0.344, similar to the estimates of\nSolon (1992) and Zimmerman (1992) in survey data when using multi-year income averages.\nThe remaining columns in the first row of Table II replicate the log-log specification for alter-\nnative samples analyzed in the prior literature. Columns 2-5 split the sample by the child’s gender\nand the parents’ marital status in the year they first claim the child. Column 6 replicates Column\n1 for the extended sample of 1980-85 birth cohorts. The IGE estimates are similar for males and\nfemales, butarelowerwhenweconditiononmaritalstatusandusetheextendedsampleforreasons\nwe explain below in Section III.B.\nWhile the log-log specification is a familiar and intuitive benchmark, it suffers from two short-\ncomings that are illustrated in Figure Ib. First, the relationship between log child income and\nlog parent income is highly non-linear, consistent with the findings of Corak and Heisz (1999) in\nCanadian tax data. This is illustrated in the series in circles in Figure Ib, which plots mean log\nchild income vs. mean log family income by percentile bin, constructed using the same method as\nFigure Ia. Because of this non-linearity, the IGE is sensitive to the point of measurement in the\nincomedistribution. Forexample, restrictingthesampletoobservationsbetweenthe10thand90th\npercentileofparentincome(denotedbytheverticaldashedlinesinthegraph)yieldsaconsiderably\nhigher IGE estimate of 0.452.\nSecond, the log-log specification discards observations with zero income. The series in triangles\nin Figure Ib plots the fraction of children with zero income by parental income bin. This fraction\n11varies from 18% among the poorest families to 3% among the richest families. Dropping children\nwith zero income therefore overstates the degree of intergenerational mobility. The way in which\nthese zeros are treated can change the IGE dramatically. For instance, including the zeros by\nassigning those with zero income an income of $1 (so that the log of their income is zero) raises the\nestimated IGE to 0.618, as shown in row 2 of Table II. If instead we treat those with 0 income as\nhaving an income of $1,000, the estimated IGE becomes 0.413. Hence, small differences in the way\nchildren’s income is measured at the bottom of the distribution can produce substantial variation\nin IGE estimates.\nTo address these shortcomings of the log-log specification, we use a rank-rank specification\nsimilartothatproposedbyDahlandDeLeire(2008). Wemeasurethepercentilerankoftheparent\nbasedontheirpositioninthedistributionofparentincomesinthecoresample. Similarly, wedefine\nchildren’s percentile ranks based on their positions in the distribution of child incomes within their\nbirth cohorts. Importantly, this definition allows us to include zeros in child income.10 Unless\notherwise noted, we hold the definition of these ranks fixed based on positions in the aggregate\ndistribution, even when analyzing subgroups.\nFigure IIa presents a binned scatter plot of the mean percentile rank of children vs. their\nparents’ percentile rank. The conditional expectation of a child’s rank given her parents’ rank is\nalmost perfectly linear. Using an OLS regression, we estimate that a one percentage point (pp)\nincrease in parent rank is associated with a 0.341 pp increase in the child’s expected rank, as\nreported in row 4 of Table II.\nFigure IIb compares the rank-rank relationship in the U.S. with analogous estimates for Den-\nmark constructed using data from Boserup et al. (2013).11 The relationship between child and\nparent ranks is nearly linear in Denmark as well, suggesting that the rank-rank specification can\nprovide a good parametric summary of mobility across diverse environments. The rank-rank slope\ninDenmarkis0.180, nearlyhalfthatintheU.S.ThiscorroboratespriorfindingsthatScandinavian\neconomies have much greater relative intergenerational mobility than the United States.\nImportantly, the smaller rank-rank slope in Denmark does not necessarily mean that children\nfromlow-incomefamiliesinDenmarkdobetterthanthoseintheU.S.inabsoluteterms. Itcouldbe\n10In the case of ties, we define the rank as the mean rank for the individuals in that group. For example, if 10%\nof a birth cohort has zero income, all children with zero income would receive a percentile rank of 5.\n11The Danish sample uses the 1980-81 birth cohorts and measures child income based on mean income between\n2009-11.

One\ncannot distinguish between these possibilities based on Figure IIb because the ranks are defined\nwithin each country. One advantage of the within-U.S. CZ-level analysis implemented below is\nthat it naturally allows us to study both relative and absolute outcomes by analyzing children’s\nperformance on a fixed national scale.\nTransition Matrices. Although the rank-rank relationship has attractive statistical properties,\nthere are many other measures of mobility that may be of normative interest (see e.g., Fields and\nOk 1999). For example, one popular approach is to analyze transition matrices (e.g., Corak and\nHeisz 1999, Hertz 2006, J¨antti et al. 2006). Table III presents a quintile transition matrix: the\nprobability that a child is in quintile m of the child income distribution conditional on his parent\nbeing in quintile n of the parent income distribution. One statistic of particular interest in this\nmatrixistheprobabilityofmovingfromthebottomquintiletothetopquintile,asimplemeasureof\n“success” that we analyze below. This probability is 7.5% in the U.S. as a whole. Another notable\nfeature of the matrix is that the rate of persistence in the bottom quintile (33.7%) is similar to the\nrate of persistence in the top quintile (36.5%).\nTo facilitate the construction of other measures of mobility, we report a 100 x 100 percentile-\nlevel transition matrix for the U.S. in Online Data Table I. Using this matrix – which characterizes\nthe copula of the joint distribution of parent and child income – and the marginal distributions for\nchild and parent income reported in Online Data Table II, one can construct any mobility statistic\nof interest for the U.S. population.\nIII.B Robustness of Baseline Estimates\nWenowevaluatetherobustnessofourestimatesofthedegreeofintergenerationalpersistenceinin-\ncometoalternativespecifications. Webeginbyevaluatingtwopotentialsourcesofbiasemphasized\nin prior work: lifecycle bias and attenuation bias.\nLifecycle Bias. Prior research has shown that measuring children’s income at early ages can\nunderstate intergenerational persistence in lifetime income because children with high lifetime in-\ncomes are in college and have steeper earnings profiles when they are young (Haider and Solon,\n2006, Grawe, 2006, Solon 1999). To evaluate whether our baseline estimates suffer from such lifecy-\ncle bias, Figure IIIa plots estimates of the rank-rank slope by the age at which the child’s income is\nmeasured. To construct this figure, we measure children’s income as mean family income in 2011-\n132012 and parent income as mean family income between 1996-2000, as in our baseline analysis. We\nthen replicate the OLS regression of child income rank on parent income rank for each birth cohort\nbetween 1980-1990. For children in the 1980 birth cohort, we measure earnings in 2011-12 at age\n31-32 (denoted by 32 in the figure); for the 1990 cohort, we measure earnings at age 21-22.12 The\nrank-rank slope rises very steeply in the early 20’s as children enter the labor force, but stabilizes\naround age 30. It increases by 2.1% from age 30 to 31 and 0.2% from age 31 to 32.\nTo obtain estimates beyond age 32, we use the SOI 0.1% random sample described in Section\nII.A, which contains data back to the 1971 birth cohort. The series in triangles in Figure IIIa\nreplicates the analysis above within the SOI sample, using sampling weights to recover estimates\nrepresentative of the population. The estimates in the SOI sample are very similar to those in\nthe full population prior to age 32. After age 32, the estimates remain roughly constant. These\nfindings indicate that rank-rank correlations exhibit little lifecycle bias provided that child income\nis measured after age 30, as in our baseline definition. Estimates of the IGE using the traditional\nlog-log specification also stabilize around age 30 (not reported).\nAn analogous lifecycle bias can arise if parent income is measured at very old or young ages. In\nOnline Appendix Figure Ia we plot the rank-rank slope using the core sample, varying the 5-year\nwindow used to measure parent income from a starting year of 1996 (when parents are 41 years old\non average) to 2007 (when parents are 55 years old). The rank-rank estimates exhibit virtually no\nvariation with the age of parent income measurement within this range.\nA closely related concern is that parent income at earlier ages might matter more for children’s\noutcomes, e.g. if resources in early childhood are relevant for child development (e.g., Heckman\n2006,Duncanetal.2010). Whilewecannotmeasureparentincomebeforeage14forchildreninour\ncore sample, we can measure parent income at earlier ages for later birth cohorts. In Chetty et al.\n(2014),weusedatafromthe1993birthcohortandregressanindicatorforcollegeattendanceatage\n19 on parent income rank in each year from 1996 to 2012. We reproduce the coefficients from those\nregressions in Online Appendix Figure Ib. The relationship between college attendance rates and\nparent income rank is virtually constant when children are between ages 3 and 19. Once again, this\nresult indicates that the point at which parent income is measured (provided parents are between\nages 30-55) does not significantly affect intergenerational associations, at least in administrative\n12We vary birth cohort and hold the year of income measurement fixed to eliminate calendar year effects. We\nobtainverysimilarresultsifweinsteadtrackasinglecohortandvaryagebymeasuringearningsindifferentcalendar\nyears.\n14earnings records.13\nAttenuation Bias. Income in a single year is a noisy measure of permanent income because\nof transitory shocks and measurement error. Solon (1992), Zimmerman (1992), and Mazumder\n(2005) show that using multi-year means of parent income generate significantly higher estimates\nof intergenerational persistence in survey data. To evaluate whether our baseline estimates suffer\nfromsuchattenuationbias,FigureIIIbplotsestimatesoftherank-rankslope,varyingthenumberof\nyears used to calculate mean parent family income. To construct this figure, we measure children’s\nincome as mean family income in 2011-2012 and use the core sample of 1980-82 birth cohorts. We\nthen replicate the OLS regression of child rank on parent rank, varying the number of years used\nto calculate mean parent income from one (1996 only) to 17 (1996-2012).\nConsistent with the findings of Solon (1992), we find that the rank-rank slope rises when we\nincrease the number of years used to measure parent income from one to five. However, the rank-\nrank slope based on five years (0.341) is only 6.5%larger than theslope based onone year of parent\nincome (0.320). This 6.5% attenuation bias is considerably smaller than the 33% change in the\nIGE (from 0.3 to 0.4) reported by Solon (1992) when using a five-year average instead of one year\nof data. We find less attenuation bias for three reasons: (1) income is measured with less error in\nthe tax data than in the PSID, (2) we use family income measures rather than individual income,\nwhich fluctuates more across years, and (3) we use a rank-rank specification rather than a log-log\nspecification, which is more sensitive to income fluctuations at the bottom of the distribution.\nContrary to the findings of Mazumder (2005), the rank-rank slope is virtually unchanged by\nadding more years of data beyond five years: the estimated slope using 15 years of data to measure\nparent income (0.350) is only 2.8% larger than the baseline slope of 0.341 using 5 years of data. We\nbelieve our results differ because we directly measure parent income, whereas Mazumder imputes\nparent income based on race and education for up to 60% of the observations in his sample (see\nOnline Appendix C for further details).\nPrior studies have focused on measurement error in parent income rather than children’s in-\ncome because only the former generates attenuation bias in the standard OLS log-log regression\nspecification, insofar as the transitory measurement error in child income is unrelated to parent\nincome. This is not true in a rank-rank specification because the measurement error in children’s\n13While we cannot measure income before the year in which children turn 3, the fact that the college-income\ngradient is not declining from ages 3-19 makes it unlikely that the gradient is significantly larger prior to age 2.\nParent income ranks in year t have a correlation of 0.91 with parent income ranks in year t+1, 0.77 in year t+5,\nand0.65inyeart+15. ThedecayinthisautocorrelationwouldgenerateadecreasingslopeinthegradientinOnline\nAppendix Figure Ib if there were a discontinuous jump in the gradient prior to age 2.\n15income generates misclassification error in their ranks, which can attenuate the rank-rank slope.14\nTo evaluate the magnitude of this bias, we analyze the impact of varying the number of years\nused to measure the child’s income in Online Appendix Figure Ic. The rank-rank slope increases\nonly modestly when increasing the number of years used to compute child family income, with no\ndetectable change once one averages over at least two years, as in our baseline measure.15\nAlternative Income Definitions. In rows 5-7 of Table II, we explore the robustness of the\nbaseline rank-rank estimate to alternative definitions of child and parent income. In row 5 we\ndefine the parent’s rank based on the individual income of the parent with higher mean income\nfrom 1999-2003.16 This specification eliminates the mechanical variation in family income driven\nby the number of parents in the household, which could overstate the persistence of income across\ngenerations if parent marital status has a direct effect of children’s outcomes. The rank-rank\ncorrelation falls by approximately 10%, from 0.341 to 0.312 when we use top parent income. The\nimpactofusingindividualparentincomeinsteadoffamilyincomeismodestbecause(1)mostofthe\nvariation in parent income across households is not due to differences in marital status and (2) the\nmean ranks of children with married parents are only 4.6 percentile points higher than those with\nsingle parents. The same logic explains why we find a similar 10% reduction when we condition on\nmarital status in the baseline specification using family income (columns 4 and 5 of row 4).\nIn row 6 of Table II, we repeat this exercise for children. Here, the concern is that children of\nhigher income parents may be more likely to marry, again exaggerating the observed persistence in\nfamily income relative to individual income. Using individual income to measure the child’s rank\nhasdifferentialimpactsbythechild’sgender, consistentwithChadwickandSolon(2002). Formale\nchildren, using individual income instead of family income reduces the rank-rank correlation from\n0.336 in the baseline specification to 0.317, a 6% reduction. For female children, using individual\nincome reduces the rank-rank correlation from 0.346 to 0.257, a 26% reduction. These differences\nare likely driven by assortative mating: women with higher income parents marry men who earn\nmore, driving up the persistence of family income across generations.\n14Formally, measurement error in the child’s rank is correlated with the parent’s rank because the support of the\nchild’s rank is bounded. Intuitively, children from the highest-ranked families are more likely to be under-ranked\nthanover-rankedduetomeasurementerrorintheirincome. Asaresult,measurementerrorinchildren’sorparent’s\nincome generally leads to attenuation bias in a rank-rank specification.\n15An ancillary implication of this result is that our estimates of intergenerational mobility are not sensitive to the\nspecific calendar years used to measure child income.\n16Weuse1999-2003incomeherebecausewecannotallocateearningsacrossspousesbefore1999,asW-2formsare\navailable starting only in 1999. Note that top income rank differs from family income rank even for single parents\nbecause some individuals get married in subsequent years and because these individuals are ranked relative to the\npopulation, not relative to other single individuals.\n16Finally, in row 7 of Table II, we define a measure of child income that excludes capital and\nother non-labor income using the sum of individual wage earnings, UI benefits, SSDI benefits,\nand Schedule C self-employment income. We divide self-employment income by 2 for married\nindividuals. This individual earnings measure yields virtually identical estimates of the rank-rank\ncorrelation.\nWe conclude that our baseline measure of intergenerational persistence accurately captures the\ndegree of persistence in lifetime income across generations and focus primarily on this measure in\nthe remainder of the paper.\nIII.C College Attendance and Teenage Birth Gradients\nWe supplement our analysis of intergenerational income mobility by studying the relationship\nbetween parent income and two additional outcomes for children: college attendance and teenage\nbirth. Figure IV presents binned scatter plots of the college attendance rate of children (in Panel\nA) and the teenage birth rate for female children (in Panel B) vs. the percentile rank of parent\nfamily income using the core sample. Parent rank is defined as in the baseline specification in row\n4 of Table II. College attendance is defined as attending college in one or more years between the\nages 18 and 21, while teenage birth is defined (for females only) as having a child when the mother\nis aged 13-19; see section II.B for further details.\nThe relationships between both outcomes and parental income rank are again virtually linear.\nTheslopeforcollegeattendanceis0.675. Thatis,movingfromthelowest-incometohighest-income\nparents increases the college attendance rate by 67.5 percentage points, similar to the estimates\nreported by Bailey and Dynarski (2011) using survey data. The slope of the relationship between\nteenage birth rates and parental income rank is -0.30. These substantial correlations suggest that\nmuch of the divergence in outcomes between children from low vs. high income families emerges\nwellbeforetheyenterthelabormarket,apointwereturntobelowwhenexploringspatialvariation.\nIV Spatial Variation in Mobility\nWe now turn to our central goal of characterizing the variation in intergenerational mobility across\nareas within the U.S. We begin by defining measures of geographic location. Next, we define two\nconcepts of intergenerational mobility – relative mobility and absolute mobility – that we measure\nusing a rank-rank specification. Finally, we present estimates of relative and absolute mobility by\narea and assess the robustness of these estimates to alternative measures.\n17IV.A Geographical Units\nTo characterize the variation in children’s outcomes across areas, one must first partition the U.S.\ninto a set of geographical areas in which children grow up. One way to conceptualize the choice of\na geographical partition is using a hierarchical model in which children’s outcomes depend upon\nconditions in their immediate neighborhood (e.g., peers or resources in their city block), local\ncommunity (e.g., the quality of schools in their county), and broader metro area (e.g., local labor\nmarket conditions). To fully characterize the geography of intergenerational mobility, one would\nideally estimate all of the components of such a hierarchical model.\nAs a first step toward this goal, we begin with a coarse partition and characterize intergenera-\ntional mobility at the level of commuting zones (CZs). CZs are aggregations of counties based on\ncommuting patterns in the 1990 Census constructed by Tolbert and Sizer (1996) and introduced\nto the economics literature by Dorn (2009). Since CZs are designed to fully span the area in which\npeople live and work, they provide a natural starting point as the coarsest partition of areas. CZs\nare similar to metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), but unlike MSAs, they cover the entire U.S.\n(including rural areas). There are 741 CZs in the U.S.; on average, each CZ contains 4 counties\nand has a population of 379,786.17\nWe focus on CZ-level variation both for parsimony and because mobility statistics in narrower\nneighborhoodsmaybemoreheavilyaffectedbysortingwithinmetroareas. Becausepropertyprices\nare typically homogeneous within narrow areas and home values are highly correlated with parent\nincome, comparisons of individuals within a narrow neighborhood effectively condition on a proxy\nfor parent income. As a result, the variation in parent income across individuals in a narrow area\n(such as a city block) must be correlated with other latent factors that may affect children’s out-\ncomes directly, making it difficult to interpret the resulting mobility estimates.18 Nevertheless, to\nobtain some insight into within-CZ variation, we also report statistics on intergenerational mobility\nby county in Online Data Table III. There is almost as much variance in intergenerational mobility\nacrosscountieswithinaCZasthereisacrossCZs, suggestingthatthetotalamountofgeographical\n17See Online Appendix Figure II for an example of the Boston CZ. Note that CZs in urban areas generally have\nmuch higher populations than rural CZs. To account for this variation, we always report statistics that restrict to\nurban areas or use population-weights in addition to unweighted measures that pool all CZs.\n18For example, it would be difficult to assess intergenerational mobility within midtown Manhattan because there\nare very few low-income individuals within this homogeneously high-property-value area, and any families with low\nobserved income in such an area would have to be latently wealthy to be able to afford to live there. Although\nthe cross-CZ differences we document could certainly also be driven by differences in latent characteristics across\nindividuals, we believe that understanding why mobility differs across these broader areas of the U.S. is of greater\ndescriptiveinterestthanunderstandingvariationacrossmuchnarrowerareasthatislikelytobemechanicallyrelated\nto differences in property values.\n18variation may be even greater than that documented below.19 We defer further analysis of such\nwithin-CZ heterogeneity to future research.\nWe permanently assign each child to a single CZ based on the ZIP code from which his or her\nparent filed their tax return in the first year the child was claimed as a dependent. We interpret\nthis CZ as the area where a child grew up. Because our data begin in 1996, location is measured\nin 1996 for 95.9% of children in our core sample. For children in our core sample of 1980-82 birth\ncohorts, we therefore typically measure location when children were approximately 15 years old.\nFor the children in the more recent birth cohorts in our extended sample, location is measured at\nearlier ages. Using these more recent cohorts, we find that 83.5% of children live in the same CZ\nat age 16 as they did at age 5. Furthermore, we verify that the spatial patterns for the outcomes\nwe can measure at earlier ages (college attendance and teenage birth) are quite similar if we define\nCZs based on location at age 5 instead of age 16.\nImportantly, the CZ where a child grew up does not necessarily correspond to the CZ she lives\nin as an adult when we measure her income (at age 30) in 2011-12. In our core sample, 38% of\nchildren live in a different CZ in 2012 relative to where they grew up.\nIV.B Measures of Relative and Absolute Mobility\nIn our baseline analysis, we measure mobility at the CZ level using the core sample (1980-82\nbirth cohorts) and the definitions of parent and child family income described in Section III.A.\nImportantly, we continue to rank both children and parents based on their positions in the national\nincome distribution (rather than the distribution within their CZ), using exactly the same ranks\nas in Figure IIa.\nWe begin by examining the rank-rank relationship in selected CZs. Figure Va presents a binned\nscatter plot of the mean child rank vs. parent rank for children who grew up in the Salt Lake City,\nUT (circles) or Charlotte, NC (triangles) commuting zones. The rank-rank relationship is virtually\nlinear in both of these CZs, as at the national level. This linearity of the rank-rank relationship is\na remarkably robust property across CZs, as illustrated for the 20 largest CZs in Online Appendix\nFigure III.\nExploiting this approximate linearity, we summarize the conditional expectation of a child’s\n19The correlation between population-weighted CZ-level means of the county-level mobility measures with the\nCZ-level estimates of mobility exceeds 0.98, indicating that our approach does not suffer from aggregation bias.

Given academic and public interest in the outcomes of\npc\ndisadvantaged youth, we focus on average absolute mobility for children from families with below-\nmedian parent income (E[y |x < p = 50,c]), which we term absolute upward mobility.22 Because\nic ic\nthe rank-rank relationship is linear, the average rank of children with below-median parent income\n20We always measure percentile ranks on a 0-100 scale and slopes on a 0-1 scale, so α ranges from 0-100 and β\nc c\nranges from 0 to 1 in (2).\n21Anymeasureoftheextenttowhichparentalincomepredictschildren’soutcomesinaCZisameasureofrelative\nmobility.

The gap in absolute outcomes is largest at the\nbottom of the income distribution and nearly zero at the top. Hence, the greater relative mobility\nin this particular comparison comes purely from better absolute outcomes at the bottom of the\ndistributionratherthanworseoutcomesatthetop.

These CZs account for less than 0.05% of the U.S. population in\nthe 2000 Census. In Online Appendix Figure IV, we present a version of this map in which we use data from the\n1980-85cohortstoestimatemobilityfortheCZsthathavefewerthan250observationsinthecore(1980-82)sample.\nTheestimatesofmobilityintheCZswithmissingdataarequitesimilartothoseinneighboringCZs,consistentwith\nthe spatial autocorrelation evident in the rest of the map.\n21areas. CZs in the top decile have y¯ > 52.0, while those in the bottom decile have y¯ < 37.4.\n25,c 25,c\nNote that the 37th percentile of the family income distribution for children at age 30 is $22,900,\nwhilethe52ndpercentileis$35,500; hence,thedifferenceinupwardmobilityacrossareastranslates\nto substantial differences in children’s incomes.\nPoolingallCZs,theunweightedstandarddeviation(SD)ofy¯ is5.68;thepopulation-weighted\n25,c\nSD is 3.34. The unconditional SD of children’s income ranks (which have a Uniform distribution) is\n√\n100/ 12 = 28.9. Hence, a 1 SD improvement in CZ “quality” – as measured by its level of absolute\nupward mobility y¯ – is associated with a 5.68/28.9 = 0.20 SD increase in the expected income\n25,c\nrank of children whose parents are at the 25th percentile.24 For comparison, a 1 SD increase in\nparent income rank is associated with a 0.34 SD increase in a child’s income rank (Figure IIa).\nHence, a 1 SD improvement in CZ quality is associated with 60% as large an increase in a child’s\nincome as a 1 SD increase in her own parent’s income.\nThere are three broad spatial patterns in upward mobility evident in Figure VIa. First, upward\nmobility varies substantially at the regional level. Upward mobility is lowest in the Southeast and\nhighestintheGreatPlains. TheWestCoastandNortheastalsohavehighratesofupwardmobility,\nthough not as high as the Great Plains.\nSecond, there is substantial within-region variation as well. Using unweighted CZ-level regres-\nsions of the upward mobility estimates on Census division and state fixed effects, we estimate that\n53% of the cross-CZ variance in absolute upward mobility is within the nine Census divisions and\n36% is within states. For example, many parts of Texas exhibit relatively high rates of upward\nmobility, unlike much of the rest of the South. Ohio exhibits much lower rates of upward mobility\nthan nearby Pennsylvania. The statistics also pick up much more granular variation in upward\nmobility. For example, South Dakota generally exhibits very high levels of upward mobility, with\ntheexceptionofafewareasintheSouthwestcornerofthestate. TheseareasarethelargestNative\nAmerican reservations in the U.S. and are well known to suffer from very high rates of persistent\npoverty.\nThe third generic pattern is that urban areas tend to exhibit lower levels of intergenerational\nmobility than rural areas on average. For instance, children from low-income families who grow\n24AnanalogouscalculationusingtheestimatesofcollegeattendancegradientsbyCZinSectionV.Abelowimplies\nthata1SDincreaseinCZqualityisassociatedwitha0.19SD(9.3percentagepoint)increaseincollegeattendance\nratesforchildrenwithparentsatthe25thpercentile. UsingdatafromthePSID,Solon,PageandDuncan(2002,p390)\nestimate that a 1 SD increase in neighborhood quality is associated with a 0.32 SD increase in years of education.\nWefindlessvariationinoutcomesacrossneighborhoodspresumablybecausecommutingzonesaremuchlargerthan\nthe PSID sampling clusters analyzed by Solon, Page, and Duncan.\n22up in the Chicago area have significantly lower incomes at age 30 than those who grow up in rural\nareas in Illinois. On average, urban areas – which we define as CZs that intersect MSAs – have\nupwardmobilityofy¯ = 41.7,whileruralareashavey¯ = 45.8. Ininterpretingthiscomparison,\n25,c 25,c\nit is important to recall that our definition of geography is based on where children grew up, not\nwhere they live as adults. 44.6% of children who grow up in rural areas live in urban areas at age\n30. Among those who rose from the bottom quintile of the national income distribution to the top\nquintile, the corresponding statistic is 55.2%.\nTable IV shows statistics on intergenerational mobility for the 50 largest CZs by population.\nAmong these cities, absolute upward mobility ranges from 46.2 in the Salt Lake City area to 35.8\nin Charlotte (Column 4). There is considerable variation even between nearby cities: Pittsburgh\nis ranked second in terms of upward mobility among large metro areas, while Cleveland – approxi-\nmately 100 miles away – is ranked in the bottom 10. Upward mobility is especially low in certain\ncities in the “Rust Belt” such as Indianapolis and Columbus and cities in the Southeast such as\nAtlanta and Raleigh. The fact that children who grow up in low-income families in Atlanta and\nRaleigh fare poorly is perhaps especially striking because these cities are generally considered to\nbe booming cities in the South with relatively high rates of job growth.\nInColumn5ofTableIV,weconsideranalternativemeasureofupwardmobility: theprobability\nthat a child born to a family in the bottom quintile of the national income distribution reaches the\ntop quintile of the national income distribution. To improve precision in smaller CZs, we estimate\nthis probability pooling the 1980-1985 birth cohorts.25 The ranking of areas based on this statistic\nis similar to that based on the mean rank measure of upward mobility. The probability that a\nchild from the lowest quintile of parental income rises to the top quintile ranges is 10.8% in Salt\nLake City, compared with 4.4% in Charlotte. The city with the highest probability of moving from\nthe bottom fifth to the top fifth is San Jose, where the probability (12.9%) is nearly three times\nthat in Charlotte. Note that if parent income played no role in determining children’s outcomes,\nall quintile transition probabilities would be 20%. Hence, the variation in rates of upward mobility\nacross areas is large relative to the maximum range of 0 to 20%.\nRelative Mobility. Figure VIb presents a heat map of relative mobility. This map is constructed\n25We verify that including more recent cohorts does not generate significant bias by showing that the national\nquintile transition matrix based on the 1980-85 cohorts (Online Appendix Table IV) is virtually identical to the\nmatrix based on the 1980-82 cohorts in Table III. The complete quintile transition matrix for each CZ is reported\nin OnlineData Table VI.Combinedwith themarginal distributions ofparentand child incomeat the nationallevel\n(reportedinOnlineDataTableII),thetransitionmatricescanbeusedtoconstructanymeasureofintergenerational\nmobilitybyCZ.Forreference,wealsoprovidestatisticsonthemarginaldistributionsofparentandchildincomeby\nCZ in Online Data Table VII.\n23inthesamewayasPanelA,dividingCZsintodecilesbasedontherank-rankslope β . Inthismap,\nc\nlighter areas denote areas with greater relative mobility (lower β ). Relative mobility also varies\nc\nsubstantiallyacrossareas. Theexpectedrankofchildrenfromtherichestvs. poorestfamiliesdiffers\nby more than 40.2 percentiles in CZs in the bottom decile of relative mobility. The corresponding\ngap is less than 23.5 percentiles for CZs in the top decile.\nThe geographical patterns in relative mobility in Panel B are similar to those for absolute\nupward mobility in Panel A. The unweighted correlation across CZs between the two measures is\n-0.68; the population-weighted correlation is -0.61. This indicates that areas with greater relative\nmobility tend to have better absolute outcomes for children from low-income families.\nTo investigate the connection between absolute and relative mobility more systematically, let\nµ = E[y |x = p,c] denote a child’s expected rank given a parent rank of p in CZ c. We estimate\npc ic ic\nµ in each CZ non-parametrically as the mean value of y for children in each percentile bin of\npc ic\nparent income p = 0,...,99.26 For each of the 100 values of p, we estimate an unweighted OLS\nregression of µ on relative mobility β with one observation per CZ:\npc c\nµ = a+γ β +η .\npc p c pc\nInthisequation,γ measurestheassociationacrossCZsbetweena1unitincreaseinβ (i.e.,greater\np c\nintergenerational persistence) and mean absolute outcomes of children whose parents were at the\nth\np percentile of the national income distribution.

The coefficients γˆ are increasing with p: CZs with greater relative mobility (lower\np\nβ ) produce better outcomes for children from lower income families. The best linear fit crosses 0\nc\nat p = 85.1. Hence, increases in relative mobility are associated with better outcomes for children\nwho grow up in families below the 85th percentile on average. For families at the 85th percentile,\ndifferences in relative mobility across CZs are uncorrelated with a child’s mean rank. For families\nin the top 15%, living in a CZ with greater relative mobility is associated with worse outcomes\n26The expected value µ differs from y¯ defined above because µ is estimated non-parametrically using only\npc pc pc\ndatainpercentilebinp,whereasy¯ iscalculatedbasedonthelinearapproximationtotherank-rankrelationshipin\npc\n(2).

Observe that γ reaches only 0.2 for the richest families but is nearly\np\n-0.8 for the poorest families. Hence, differences in relative mobility across CZs are associated with\nmuch larger differences in absolute mobility for children from low-income families than high-income\nfamilies.27\nFigure VIIb presents a schematic that illustrates the intuition underlying the preceding results.\nThis figure plots hypothetical rank-rank relationships in two representative CZs, one of which has\nmore relative mobility than the other. Figure VIIa implies that in such a pairwise comparison, the\nrank-rank relationship “pivots” at the 85th percentile on average. This is why the spatial patterns\nof absolute mobility at p = 25 and relative mobility in Figure VI look similar.\nBecause the pivot point is very high in the income distribution, differences in relative mobility\nhave a smaller effect on children’s percentile ranks in high-income families than low-income fami-\nlies.28 This may be because the rich are able to insulate themselves from differences in the local\nenvironment. If the differences in relative mobility across areas are caused by differences in local\npolicies, this result suggests that one may be able to improve the outcomes of children from poor\nfamilies without hurting children from high income families significantly.\nIV.D Robustness of Spatial Patterns\nIn Table V, we assess the robustness of the spatial patterns in mobility documented above along\nthree dimensions: (1) changes in sample definitions, (2) changes in income measures, and (3)\nadjustments for factors such as differences in the cost-of-living across areas. Each cell in the table\nreports the correlation across CZs of our baseline mobility measure (using child family income rank\nand parent family income rank in the core sample) with an alternative mobility measure described\nineachrow.

In the first section of Table V, we assess the robustness of the spatial\n27If the rank-rank relationship were perfectly linear, the relationship plotted in Figure VIIa would be perfectly\nlinear and γ −γ =1 mechanically.

Rows 1\nand 2 restrict the sample to male and female children, respectively. Rows 3 and 4 consider the\nsubsamples of married parents and single parents. The correlations of both absolute and relative\nmobility in these subsamples with the corresponding baseline measures is typically above 0.9.\nInrow5, wereplicatethebaselinespecificationsusingthe1983-85birthcohorts(whoseincomes\nare measured at age 27 on average in 2011-12). In row 6, we consider the 1986-88 birth cohorts\ninstead. The intergenerational mobility estimates across CZs for these later birth cohorts are\nvery highly correlated with the baseline estimates. This result has three implications. First, it\ndemonstrates that the reliability of CZ-level estimates is quite high across cohorts; in particular,\nsampling error or cohort-specific shocks do not lead to much fluctuation in the CZ-level estimates.\nSecond, because the later cohorts are linked to parents at earlier ages (as early as age 8), we\nconclude that the spatial patterns in intergenerational mobility are not sensitive to the precise age\nat which we link children to parents or measure their geographical location. Finally, because the\nearnings of later cohorts are measured at earlier ages, we conclude that one can detect the spatial\ndifferences in mobility even when measuring earnings quite early in children’s careers.\nIn row 7, we restrict the sample based on the age of parents at the birth of the child. We limit\nthe sample to children whose mothers are between the ages of 24-28 and fathers are between 26-30\n(a five year window around the median age of birth). The intergenerational mobility estimates in\nthissubsampleareveryhighlycorrelatedwiththebaselineestimates, indicatingthatthecross-area\ndifferences in income mobility are not biased by differences in the age of child birth for low income\nindividuals.\nIn row 8, we assess the extent to which the variation in intergenerational mobility comes from\nchildren who succeed and move out of the CZ as adults vs. children who stay within the CZ. To\ndo so, we restrict the sample to the 62% of children who live in the same CZ in 2012 as where\nthey grew up. Despite the fact that this sample is endogenously selected on an ex-post outcome,\nthe mobility estimates remain very highly correlated with those in the full sample. Apparently,\nareas such as Salt Lake City that generate high levels of upward income mobility do so not just\nby sending successful children to other CZs as adults but also by helping children move up in the\nincome distribution within the area.\nIn row 9, we restrict the sample to the 88% of children in the core sample who are not claimed\nas dependents by other individuals in subsequent years after they are linked to the parents we\nidentify. We obtain very similar estimates for this “unique parent” subsample, indicating that the\n26spatial pattern of our mobility estimates is not distorted by measurement error in linking children\nto their parents.\nIncome Definitions. In the second section of Table V, we evaluate the sensitivity of the spatial\npatterns to alternative definitions of income. The definitions we consider match those in the\nrobustness analysis in Table II; see Section II.B for details on these definitions. In row 10 of\nTable V, we define parent income as the income of the higher earner rather than total family\nincome to evaluate potential biases from differences in parent marital status across areas. In row\n11, we measure the child’s income using individual income instead of family income to assess the\neffects of differences in the child’s marital status. In row 12, we use the child’s individual earnings\n(excluding capital and other non-labor income). In row 13, we replicate the specification in row 8\nfor male children, using individual income for the child and family income for the parent. Row 14\nreplicates row 13, but defines the parents’ income as the income of the higher earner instead. All\nof these definitions produce very similar spatial patterns in intergenerational mobility: correlations\nwith the baseline measures exceed 0.9 in most cases.\nCost-of-Living, Local Growth, and Other Factors. The third section of Table V considers a set\nof other factors that could bias comparisons of intergenerational mobility across areas. One natural\nconcern is that our estimates of upward mobility may be affected by differences in prices across\nareas. To evaluate the importance of differences in cost of living, we construct a CZ-level price\nindex using the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) price index for\nurban areas combined with information on housing values, population density, and CZ location\n(see Online Appendix A for details). We then divide parents’ income by the price index for the CZ\nwhere their child grew up and the child’s income by the price index for the CZ where she lives as\nan adult (in 2012) to obtain real income measures.\nRow 15 of Table V shows that the measures of intergenerational mobility based on real incomes\nare very highly correlated with our baseline measures (see also Online Appendix Figure Va). The\nreason that cost-of-living adjustments have little effect is that prices affect both the parent and\nthe child. Intuitively, in high-priced areas such as New York City, adjusting for prices reduces the\nchild’s absolute rank in the national real income distribution. But adjusting for prices also lowers\nthe real income rank of parents living in New York City. As a result, the degree of upward mobility\n– i.e., the difference between the child’s rank and the parent’s rank – is essentially unaffected by\nadjusting for local prices. The preceding logic assumes that children always live in the same cities\nin their parents. In practice, some children move to areas with higher prices (e.g. from rural Iowa\n27to New York City). Our measures of upward mobility are affected by the cost of living adjustment\nin such cases, but they are not sufficiently frequent to have a large impact on our estimates. The\ncorrelationbetweenthecostoflivinginthechild’sCZatage30andtheparent’sCZis0.77andthe\ncorrelationbetweenachild’snominalpercentilerankandthelocalpriceindexisonly0.10. Because\nof these two factors, cost of living adjustments end up having a minor impact on the difference\nbetween child and parent income and thus have little effect on our mobility statistics.\nAnother potential concern with our approach is that using national ranks may misrepresent the\ndegree of relative mobility within the local income distribution, which may better reflect a child’s\nopportunities. To address this concern, in row 16 of Table V, we measure relative mobility using\nlocal ranks. We rank parents relative to other parents living in the same CZ and children relative\nto other children who grew up in the same CZ (no matter where they live as adults). We define\nrelative mobility as the slope of the local rank-rank relationship.29 Relative mobility based on local\nranks is very highly correlated with relative mobility based on national ranks. This is because local\nranks are approximately a linear transformation of national ranks.\nIn row 17, we measure absolute upward mobility based on the probability that the child rises\nfrom the bottom quintile of parent income to the top quintile of child income, as in Column 5 of\nTable IV. The spatial pattern in this measure – shown in the map in Online Appendix Figure Vb\n– is very similar to that in our mean-rank based measure of upward mobility, with a correlation\nacross CZs above 0.9.\nPart of the variation in upward mobility across areas could be driven by shocks to economic\ngrowth. Becausewemeasureparentincomebefore2000andchildincomein2011-12,localeconomic\ngrowth in the intervening decade would lead the child to be ranked higher in the national income\ndistribution than the parent. While shocks to economic growth – e.g., from the discovery of a\nnatural resource such as oil – are a real source of upward mobility, one may be interested in\nisolating variation in mobility that is attributable to more stable factors that may be manipulable\nby policy. We assess the extent to which economic growth is responsible for the spatial variation\nin upward mobility in two ways. In row 18, we define parent income as mean family income in\n2011-12, the same years in which we measure child income. Insofar as local economic growth raises\nthe incomes of both parents and children, this measure nets out the effects of growth on mobility.\nBoth the upward and relative mobility measures remain very highly correlated with the baseline\n29We cannot study absolute mobility with local ranks because both child and parent ranks have a mean of 50 by\ndefinition: if one child moves up in the local distribution, another must move down.\n28measures, suggesting that differences in local economic growth drive relatively little of the spatial\nvariation in mobility.\nOnelimitationofusingparentincomein2011-12tonetoutgrowtheffectsisthatgrowthshocks\nmay have bigger effects on younger workers who are just entering the labor force. As an alternative\napproach, we regress our measures of mobility on the CZ-level growth rate from 2000-2010 and\ncalculate residuals.30 Row 19 of Table V shows that the correlation of the growth-adjusted relative\nmobility measures with the baseline measures exceeds 0.9; the correlations for absolute mobility\nexceed 0.8. Note that these growth-adjusted measures over-control for exogenous growth shocks\ninsofar as growth is partly a consequence of factors that generate upward income mobility in an\narea. Hence, the fact that even controlling for growth rates directly does not significantly change\nthe spatial pattern of intergenerational mobility supports the view that most of the variation in\nmobility across areas is not due to exogenous growth shocks in the 2000’s.\nIV.E College Attendance and Teenage Birth Gradients\nIn Figure VIII, we explore the geographical variation in the gradients of college attendance rates\nand teenage birth rates with respect to parent income, which we plotted at the national level in\nFigureIV.ToconstructFigureVIIIa, weregresscollegeattendanceonparentnationalincomerank\nin each CZ c. We use the same specification as in (1), replacing the dependent variable with an\nindicator for attending college at some point between the ages of 18-21. The map plots the slope\nfrom these regressions in each CZ, dividing the CZs into deciles (with darker colors representing\nareas with steeper slopes), as in Figure VIa.\nThereissubstantialvariationacrossCZsintheassociationbetweenparentincomeandchildren’s\ncollege attendance rates. CZs in the top decile of college-income gradients have β > 0.8, i.e.\nc\nchildren of the highest income parents are 80 percentage points more likely to attend college than\nchildren of the lowest income parents. CZs in the bottom decile have β < 0.53. Moreover,\nc\nthe spatial variation in college-income gradients is highly correlated with the spatial variation in\nthe intergenerational income mobility.31 The unweighted correlation across CZs of the gradients\n30Wemeasureincomein2000usingtheCensusandin2008usingthe5-yearAmericanCommunitySurvey,averaged\nover 2006-2010. We calculate household income per working age adult as aggregate income in a CZ divided by the\nnumber of individuals aged 16-64 in that CZ. Annualized income growth is calculated as the annual growth rate\nimplied by the change in income over the 8 year period; we use 8 years because 2008 is the midpoint of 2006-2010.\n31As above, we define absolute mobility for the college outcome as the mean college attendance rate for children\nwhoseparentsareatthe25thpercentile,basedonthelinearregressionofcollegeattendanceonparentrank. Aswith\nearnings, areas with flatter college by parent income gradients (i.e., greater relative mobility) tend to have higher\ncollege attendance rates for lower income children (i.e., greater absolute upward mobility). The slopes of the college\nand teenage birth gradients and absolute mobility measures for each CZ are reported in Online Data Table V.\n29in Figure VIIIa with the corresponding relative mobility measures based on children’s income in\nFigure VIa is ρ = 0.68 (row 20 of Table V).\nFigure VIIIb repeats the analysis in Figure VIIIa using an indicator for having a teenage birth,\ndefined as in Figure IVb. In this figure, we restrict the sample to females. CZs in the bottom decile\n(those with the steepest negative gradients) have β < −0.37. That is, daughters of the lowest\nc\nincome parents are 37 percentage points more likely to have a child while they are teenagers than\ndaughters of the highest income parents. CZs in the top decile have β > −0.18. Once again, this\nc\nspatial variation is quite highly correlated with the variation in intergenerational earnings mobility\n(row 21 of Table V).\nAn important implication of these results is that much of the difference in intergenerational\nmobility across areas emerges before children enter the labor market.32 This suggests that the\nspatial variation in income mobility is driven by factors that either directly affect children at\nearly ages – e.g., the quality of schools or social structure – or anticipatory behavioral responses\nto subsequent differences, such as returns to education in the local labor market. We explore\nmechanisms that have such properties in the next section.\nV Correlates of Intergenerational Mobility\nWhydosomeareasoftheU.S.exhibitmuchhigherratesofupwardmobilitythanothers? Asafirst\nstep toward answering this question, we correlate our measures of intergenerational mobility with\nlocal area characteristics. Naturally, such correlations cannot be interpreted as causal mechanisms.\nOur goal here is merely to document a set of stylized facts that we hope will be helpful in guiding\nthesearchforcausaldeterminantsandthedevelopmentofnewmodelsofintergenerationalmobility.\nWeorganizeouranalysisofsuchmechanismsaroundasetoffactorsthathavebeendiscussedin\nthe sociology and economics literature: (1) race, (2) segregation, (3) income levels and inequality,\n(4) local public goods and tax policies, (5) primary school quality, (6) access to higher education,\n(7) local labor market conditions, (8) migration and networks, (9) social capital, and (10) family\nstructure.\nBecausemostofthesefactorsareslow-movingandwehaveestimatesofintergenerationalincome\nmobilityforessentiallyonebirthcohort,wefocusoncross-sectionalcorrelationsratherthanchanges\n32Thefactthatcollegeandteenagebirthgradientsaresimilartoincomemobilitygradientsprovidesfurtherevidence\nthatgrowthshocksinthe2000sdonotgeneratethedifferencesinmobilityacrossareas,ascollegeandteenagebirth\nare measured around 2000. These results also show that the spatial patterns are unlikely to be driven by differences\nin reporting of taxable income.\n30over time. For most covariates, we use data from the 2000 Census and other publicly available\ndatasets because many variables cannot be consistently measured in earlier years. We verify that\nresultsaresimilarusingdatafrom1990forselectedvariables. SeeOnlineAppendixDfordetailson\nthe construction of the covariates analyzed in this section and Online Data Table VIII for CZ-level\ndata on each of the covariates.\nV.A Race\nPerhaps the most obvious pattern from the maps in Figure VI is that intergenerational mobility\nis lower in areas with larger African-American populations, such as the Southeast. We therefore\nbegin by exploring the role of race in upward mobility. Throughout our analysis of correlations, we\nfocus primarily on our baseline measure of absolute upward mobility (y¯ ). Correlations of area\n25,c\ncharacteristics with relative mobility are similar, which is to be expected since absolute upward\nmobility and relative mobility are themselves highly correlated as shown above.\nFigure IXa presents a binned scatter plot of absolute upward mobility (y¯ ) in each CZ vs.\n25,c\nthe fraction of black individuals living in that CZ, based on data from the 2000 Census. The\nfigure is constructed using one observation for each of the 709 CZs for which we have more than\n250 parent-child pairs. To construct the binned scatter plot, we divide the variable plotted on the\nx-axis (% black in the CZ) into 20 equally sized bins (vingtiles) and plot the mean value of the\nvariable plotted on the y-axis (absolute upward mobility) vs. the mean value of the x variable\nwithin each bin. We also report the unweighted correlation between the x and y variables, with\nstandard error clustered at the state level to correct for spatial correlation across CZs. To facilitate\ncomparisonsacrossfiguresthatplottherelationshipbetweenupwardmobilityanddifferentfactors,\nwe always use a fixed y scale ranging from 35 to 55, approximately the 5th to 95th percentile of\nthe distribution of y¯ across CZs.\n25,c\nFigure IXa confirms that areas with larger African-American populations do in fact have sub-\nstantially lower rates of upward mobility. The correlation between upward mobility and fraction\nblackis-0.585. Inareasthathavesmallblackpopulations, childrenborntoparentsatthe25thper-\ncentile can expect to reach the median of the national income distribution on average (y¯ = 50);\n25,c\nin areas with large African-American populations, y¯ is only 35.\n25,c\nThe correlation in Figure IXa could be driven by two very different channels. One channel is an\nindividual-level race effect: black children may have lower incomes than white children conditional\non parent income, and hence areas with a larger black population may have lower upward mobility.\n31An alternative possibility is a place-level race effect: areas with large black populations might have\nlower rates of upward mobility for children of all races. To distinguish between these two channels,\none would ideally control for race at the individual level, essentially asking whether whites have\nlower rates of upward mobility in areas with a larger black population.\nUnfortunately, we do not observe race in our data. As an alternative, we predict race based on\nthe parent’s 5-digit ZIP code (in the year they first claim their child as a dependent). We use data\nfrom the 2000 Census to measure racial shares by ZIP code. Figure IXb replicates our measures\nof absolute upward mobility (y¯ ) by CZ, restricting the sample to ZIP codes within each CZ in\n25,c\nwhichatleast80%oftheresidentsarenon-hispanicwhites.33 Inthissubsample, 91%ofindividuals\nare white. The spatial pattern in Figure IXb is very similar to that in the original map for the\nfull sample in Figure VIa. Most notably, even in this predominantly white sample, rates of upward\nmobility remain low in the Southeast and are much higher in the West. Among the 604 CZs for\nwhich we are able to compute upward mobility measures for predominantly white individuals, the\nunweighted correlation between upward mobility for the predominantly white sample and the full\nsample is 0.91.\nIn Figure IXc, we generalize this approach to assess how the spatial pattern of upward mobility\nchanges as we restrict the sample to be increasingly white. To construct this figure, we first\ncompute upward mobility in each CZ, restricting the sample to individuals living in ZIP codes that\nare more than w% white, which we denote by y¯w . We then regress y¯w on y¯ , our baseline\n25,c 25,c 25,c\nestimates of upward mobility based on the full sample, using an unweighted OLS regression with\none observation per CZ with available data. We vary w from 0% to 95% in increments of 5%\nand plot the resulting regression coefficients in Figure IXc against the fraction of white individuals\nin each of the subsamples. When w = 0, the regression coefficient is 1 by construction because\ny¯ = y¯w=0. Since 75% of the U.S. population is white, the first point on the figure is (0.75,\n25,c 25,c\n1). The point generated by the w = 80% threshold is (0.91, 0.84), consistent with the map in\nFigure IXb. The dotted lines show a 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficients based\non standard errors clustered at the state level.\nIfthevariationinupwardmobilityacrossareaswereentirelydrivenbyheterogeneityinoutcomes\nacross race at the individual level, the coefficient in Figure IXc would fall to zero as the fraction\n33We continue to estimate y¯ at the CZ level in this map, but we only include ZIP-5’s within each CZ in which\n25,c\n80% or more of the residents are white. To facilitate comparison to Figure VI, we color the entire CZ based on this\nstatistic, including ZIP-5’s whose own white share is below 80%. CZs that have fewer than 250 children who grew\nup in ZIP codes where more than 80% of the residents are white are omitted (and shown with cross-hatch shading).\n32white in the sample converged to 1, as illustrated by the dashed line. Intuitively, if all of the spatial\nvariation in Figure VIa were driven by individual-level differences in race, there would be no spatial\nvariation left in a purely white sample. The data reject this hypothesis: even in the subsample\nwith more than 95% white individuals, the regression coefficient remains at 0.89.\nThe main lesson of the analysis in this section is that both blacks and whites living in areas\nwithlargeAfrican-Americanpopulationshavelowerratesofupwardincomemobility. Onepotential\nmechanism for this pattern is the historical legacy of greater segregation in areas with more blacks.\nSuch segregation could potentially affect both low-income whites and blacks, as racial segregation\nis often associated with income segregation. We turn to the relationship between segregation and\nupward mobility in the next section.\nV.B Segregation\nPrior work has argued that segregation has negative effects on economic and social outcomes\nthroughvariouschannels: reducingexposuretosuccessfulpeersandrolemodels,decreasingfunding\nforlocalpublicgoodssuchasschools,orhamperingaccesstonearbyjobs(Wilson1987,Masseyand\nDenton 1993, Cutler and Glaeser 1997). Motivated by these theories, we explore the relationship\nbetween intergenerational mobility and various measures of segregation.\nWe begin by estimating the association between racial segregation and upward mobility. Fol-\nlowing Iceland (2004), we measure segregation using a Theil (1972) index, constructed using data\nfrom the 2000 Census.34 Let p denote the fraction of individuals of race r in a given CZ, with\nr\nfour racial groups: whites, blacks, hispanics, and others. We measure the level of racial diver-\nsity in the CZ by an entropy index: E = (cid:80) p log 1 , with p log 1 = 0 when p = 0. Letting\nr 2 pr r 2pr r\nj = 1,...,N index census tracts in the CZ, we analogously measure racial diversity within each\ntract as E = (cid:80) p log 1 where p denotes the fraction of individuals of race r in tract j. We\nj rj 2 prj rj\ndefine the degree of racial segregation in the CZ as\n(cid:88) pop j E −E j\nH = [ ] (3)\npop E\ntotal\nj\n34As Iceland (2004) argues, the Theil index is an attractive measure conceptually because it captures segregation\nacrossmultipleracialgroups. However,weobtainsimilarresultsusingalternativetwo-groupmeasuresofblack-white\nsegregation such as isolation indices or dissimilarity indices because alternative measures of segregation are highly\ncorrelatedatthelevelofmetroareas(Cutleretal.1999). Thesegregationpatternsaresufficientlystarkthatonecan\ndirectlyseethedifferencesinsegregationbetweentheleastandmostupwardlymobilecitiesusingthecolor-codeddot\nmapsproducedbyCable(2013)usingCensusdata. Forinstance,compareAtlanta–oneofthemostsegregatedcities\nand one of the lowest-mobility cities in our data – to Sacramento – one of the most integrated and highest-mobility\ncities.\n33where pop denotes the total population of tract j and pop denotes the total population of\nj total\nthe CZ. Intuitively, H measures the extent to which the racial distribution in each Census tract\ndeviates from the overall racial distribution in the CZ. The segregation index H is maximized at\nH = 1 when there is no racial heterogeneity within census tracts, in which case E = 0 in all tracts.\nj\nIt is minimized at H(p) = 0 when racial diversity within each tract – as measured by entropy E\nj\n– is the same across all tracts.\nColumn 1 of Table VI reports the coefficient estimate from an unweighted OLS regression of\nabsolute upward mobility y¯ on the racial segregation index, with one observation per CZ. In\n25,c\nthis and all subsequent regressions in this paper, we standardize the dependent variable and all\nindependent variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 within the estimation sample.\nHence, the coefficients in the univariate regressions can be interpreted as correlation coefficients.\nStandard errors are clustered by state to account for spatial correlation across CZs.\nMore racially segregated areas have less upward mobility: the unweighted correlation between\nupward mobility and the racial segregation index in Column 1 is -0.361. See Online Appendix\nFigure VIa for the corresponding non-parametric binned scatter plot. Column 2 shows that the\ncorrelation remains at -0.360 in urban areas, i.e. CZs that overlap with metropolitan statistical\nareas (MSAs).\nNext, we turn to the relationship between income segregation and upward mobility. Following\nReardon and Firebaugh (2002) and Reardon (2011), we begin by measuring the degree to which\nth\nindividuals below the p percentile of the local household income distribution are segregated from\nth\nindividuals above the p percentile in each CZ using a two-group Theil index H(p). Here, entropy\nin a given area is E(p) = plog 1+(1−p)log 1 and the index H(p) is defined using the formula\n2 p 2 1−p\nin (3). Building on this measure, Reardon (2011) defines the overall level of income segregation in\na given CZ as\n´\nincome segregation = 2log(2) E(p)H(p)dp. (4)\np\nThis measure is simply a weighted average of segregation at each percentile p, with greater weight\nplaced on percentiles in the middle of the income distribution, where entropy E(p) is maximized.\nWe implement (4) using data from the 2000 Census, which reports income binned in 16 categories.\nFollowing Reardon (2011, Appendix 3), we measure H(p) at each of these cutoffs and take a\nweighted sum of these values to calculate income segregation.\nIn Column 3 of Table VI, we regress absolute upward mobility on the income segregation index;\nsee Online Appendix Figure VIb for the corresponding non-parametric binned scatter plot. The\n34correlation between income segregation and upward mobility is -0.393. Interestingly, areas with a\nlarger black population exhibit greater income segregation: the correlation between the fraction\nof black individuals in a CZ and the income segregation index is 0.271 (s.e. 0.077). Hence, the\nnegative relationship between income segregation and upward mobility could partly explain why\nlow-income white children fare more poorly in areas with large African-American populations.\nIn Column 4, we decompose the effects of segregation in different parts of the income distribu-\ntion. Following Reardon and Bischoff (2011), we define the “segregation of poverty” as H(p = 25),\ni.e. the extent to which individuals in the bottom quartile are segregated from those above the\n25th percentile. We analogously define the segregation of affluence as H(p = 75). Conditional on\nthe degree of segregation of affluence, segregation of poverty is strongly negatively correlated with\nupward mobility. However, there is no significant relationship between the segregation of affluence\nand upward mobility conditional on segregation of poverty. Column 5 shows that the same pattern\nholds when restricting the sample to urban areas.\nThese results suggest that it is the isolation of low-income families rather than the isolation\nof the rich that may be most detrimental for low income children’s prospects of moving up in the\nincome distribution. One explanation of this correlation is that the separation of the middle class\nfrom the poor reduces beneficial peer effects or funding for local public goods (e.g., schools) for\nchildren from low-income families. In contrast, the separation of the affluent from the middle class\nmay not directly harm low income individuals.\nAnother mechanism by which segregation may diminish upward mobility is through spatial\nmismatch in access to jobs (Kain 1968, Kasarda 1989, Wilson 1996). We explore this mechanism in\nColumn 6 by correlating upward mobility with the fraction of individuals who commute less than\n15 minutes to work in the CZ, based on data from the 2000 Census. Areas with less sprawl (shorter\ncommutes) have significantly higher rates of upward mobility: the correlation between commute\ntimes and upward mobility is 0.6, higher than the univariate correlation with any of the measures\nof segregation.\nIn Column 7, we regress upward mobility on both the commute time variable and income seg-\nregation. Commute times remain strongly associated with upward mobility conditional on income\nsegregation, but income segregation is not significantly correlated with upward mobility once we\ncondition on commute times. These results are consistent with the view that the negative impacts\nof segregation may operate by making it more difficult to reach jobs or other resources that fa-\ncilitate upward mobility. Note that any such spatial mismatch explanation must explain why the\n35gradients emerge before children enter the labor market, as shown in Section IV.E. A lack of access\nto nearby jobs cannot directly explain why children from low-income families are also more likely\nto have teenage births and less likely to attend college in cities with low levels of upward mobility.\nHowever, spatial mismatch could produce such patterns if it changes children’s behavior because\nthey have fewer successful role models or reduces their perceived returns to education.\nWe summarize our results on segregation in the first panel of Figure X. Figure X plots the\nunweighted univariate correlation between absolute upward mobility and various CZ-level char-\nacteristics, using all CZs with available data for the relevant variable. The dots show the point\nestimate of the correlation and the horizontal lines show a 95% confidence interval, based on stan-\ndard errors clustered at the state level. The sign of the correlation is shown in parentheses next to\neach variable.\nTable VII reports each of the correlations corresponding to Figure X in Column 1 and evaluates\ntheirrobustnesstoalternativespecificationsintheothercolumns.

Finally, in\nColumn 6, we correlate each covariate with relative mobility β .\nc\nWe find a significant negative correlation between upward income mobility and each of our\nthree primary proxies for segregation – racial segregation, income segregation, and commute times\n– across all the specifications in Table VII.36 Importantly, this correlation holds even within states\n(Column 2), showing that the pattern is not just driven by broad regional differences across the\nSouthvs. otherpartsofthecountry. Segregationisalsostronglynegativelycorrelatedwithrelative\nmobility (i.e., positively correlated with β ).\nc\n35We normalize all variables by their weighted standard deviations in this and all other specifications that use\nweights, so that univariate regression coefficients can be interpreted as weighted correlations.\n36Wealsoreplicatedthisanalysisusingmeasuresofsegregationfromthe1990Censusandfindverysimilarresults.\nFor example, the correlation between upward mobility and the Theil racial segregation index measured using the\n1990Censusis-0.357,comparedwith-0.361whenmeasuredusingthe2000Census. Thecorrelationbetweenupward\nmobility and income segregation is -0.393 using both the 1990 and 2000 Census.\n36V.C Income Levels and Inequality\nSeveral studies have proposed that there may be a link between properties of the static income dis-\ntribution – for instance, levels of inequality within a generation – and the level of intergenerational\nmobility (e.g., Corak 2013). In this subsection, we explore the correlation between properties of\nthe local income distribution and upward income mobility.\nMean Income Levels. Figure XIa presents a binned scatter plot of absolute upward mobility\nvs. the mean level of household income per working age adult in the CZ, as measured in the 2000\nCensus.37 ThereislittlerelationshipbetweenmeanCZ-levelincomeandupwardmobility. Children\nin low-income families who grow up in the highest-income CZs (with mean incomes of $47,600 per\nyear) reach almost exactly the same percentile of the national income distribution on average as\nthose who grow up in the lowest-income areas (with mean incomes of $21,900).\nThe result in Figure XIa stands in contrast with the results on income segregation above, which\neffectively shows that low-income children who grow up in census tracts with higher levels of mean\nincome have better outcomes. This may be because peer effects and the provision of public goods\noperate at a narrow geographic level. Living in a higher income metro area might not benefit\nlow-income children if it has no effect on their peer group or resources due to income segregation\nwithin the CZ.\nIncome Inequality. Figure XIb presents a binned scatter plot of upward mobility vs. the Gini\ncoefficient of parent income within each CZ. We compute the Gini coefficient for parents in our\ncore sample within each CZ as Gini = 2Cov(z ,x ), where z¯ is the mean family income (from\nz¯c ic ic c\n1996-2000) of parents in CZ c and Cov(z ,x ) is the covariance between the income level (z )\nic ic ic\nand the percentile rank (x ) of parents in CZ c. The correlation between the Gini coefficient and\nic\nupward mobility is -0.578, implying that there is a “Great Gatsby” relationship within the U.S.\nsimilar to that documented across countries in prior work.\nAn alternative measure of inequality is the portion of income within a CZ that accrues to the\nrichest households, e.g. those in the top 1%. This measure is of particular interest because the rise\nin inequality in the U.S. over the past three decades was driven primarily by an increase in top\nincome shares (Piketty and Saez 2003). We calculate top 1% income shares using the distribution\nof parent family income within each CZ. Figure XIc shows that the relationship between upward\nmobility and the top 1% income share is much weaker (correlation = -0.190).\n37We find similar results using mean income in 1990; however, we find a positive correlation with mean income in\n2010, reflecting the correlation with income growth documented above.\n37WeinvestigatewhytheGinicoefficientandtop1%shareproducedifferentresultsinTableVIII,\nwhichisconstructedinthesamewayasTableVI.Column1replicatestheregressioncorresponding\nto Figure XIb as a reference. We decompose the Gini coefficient into inequality coming from the\nupper tail and the rest of the income distribution by defining the bottom 99% Gini as the Gini\ncoefficientminusthetop1%incomeshare. Thebottom99%Ginicanbeinterpretedasthedeviation\nof the Lorenz curve from perfect equality amongst households in the bottom 99%. Column 2 of\nTable VIII shows that a 1 SD increase in the bottom 99% Gini is associated with a 0.634 SD\nreduction in upward mobility. In contrast, a 1 SD increase in the top 1% share is associated with\nonly a 0.123 SD reduction in upward mobility. Column 3 replicates Column 2 for urban areas (CZs\nthat overlap with MSAs). The pattern in urban areas is even more stark: upper tail inequality is\nuncorrelated with upward mobility, whereas the Gini coefficient within the bottom 99% remains\nvery highly strongly correlated with upward mobility.\nAn alternative and perhaps more intuitive measure of inequality within the bottom 99% is the\nsize of the middle class in the CZ, which we define as the fraction of parents in the CZ who have\nfamily incomes between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the national parent income distribution.\nColumn 4 of Table VIII shows that upward mobility is strongly positively correlated with the size\nof the middle class.\nFinally, Column5ofTableVIIIreplicatesColumn2usingrelativemobilityβ asthedependent\nc\nvariable. The bottom 99% Gini coefficient is strongly positively associated with this measure, i.e.\ngreater inequality in the bottom 99% is negatively related to relative mobility.38 But once again,\nthe top 1% share is uncorrelated with relative mobility.\nWesummarizeourresultsonpropertiesoftheincomedistributionandevaluatetheirrobustness\nin the second panel of Table VII and Figure X. Across all the specifications, we find (1) little\nassociation between mean income levels and mobility, (2) a robust negative relationship between\nthe bottom 99% Gini coefficient and mobility, and (3) little relationship between the top 1% share\nand mobility.\nComparison to Cross-Country Evidence. The preceding analysis shows that the correlation\nbetween inequality and intergenerational mobility across areas within the U.S. is driven primarily\nby “middle class” inequality – i.e., inequality within the bottom 99% – rather than the concen-\ntration of income in the upper tail. Is this also the case with the original “Great Gatsby” curve\n38Importantly, because parent and child ranks are measured in the national income distribution, there is no me-\nchanical relationship between the level of inequality within the CZs income distribution and the rank-rank slope.\n38documented by Corak (2006, 2013) across countries? We answer this question using estimates of\nthe intergenerational elasticity (IGE) from 13 developed countries compiled by Corak (2013). In\nColumn 6 of Table VIII, we replicate Corak’s (2013, Figure 1) result that there is a strong positive\ncorrelation between the Gini coefficient (as measured in survey data on income in 1985) and the\nIGE.39 In Column 7, we include the top 1% income share in each country, based on statistics from\nthe World Top Incomes Database. As in the within-U.S. analysis, there is little correlation between\nthe top 1% income share and intergenerational mobility across countries. Column 8 shows that\nresults are similar if one uses inequality measures from 2005 instead of 1985.\nWe conclude that there is a robust negative correlation between inequality within the current\ngeneration of adults and mobility across generations. However, intergenerational mobility is pri-\nmarily correlated with “middle-class” inequality and not the extreme upper tail inequality of the\nform that has increased dramatically in recent decades. Interestingly, this pattern parallels the\nresults we obtained for segregation above: segregation of affluence is not significantly correlated\nwith intergenerational mobility, while segregation of poverty (the separation of the poor from the\nmiddle class) is strongly negative associated with mobility.\nV.D Local Public Goods and Tax Policies\nEconomic models of intergenerational mobility predict that the provision of local public goods or\ntax credits to low income families can relax credit constraints and increase mobility (e.g., Becker\nand Tomes 1979, Becker and Tomes 1986, Mulligan 1997, Ichino et al. 2011). In this subsection,\nwe assess whether variation in local tax and expenditure policies explain the geographical variation\nin mobility. We report these results in the third panel of Figure X and Table VII.\nWe begin by correlating upward mobility with local tax rates. We measure the average local\ntax rate in each CZ as total tax revenue collected at the county or lower level in the CZ (based\non the 1992 Census of Governments) divided by total household income in the CZ based on the\n1990 Census.40 Note that 75% of local tax revenue comes from property taxes; hence, this measure\nlargelycapturesvariationinpropertytaxrates. Inthebaselineunweightedspecificationpoolingall\n39WeinterpretCorak’sestimatesoftheGinicoefficientasmeasuresthatapplytothebottom99%becausesurveys\ntypically do not capture the thickness of the top tail due to top-coding.\n40Governmentexpendituresintheneighborhoodswherelow-incomefamilieslivewithintheCZ(ratherthanaverage\ngovernment expenditures) may be more relevant for upward mobility. To evaluate this possibility, we reconstructed\neach of the measures of public goods and school quality analyzed in this and the next subsection, weighting by the\nnumber of below-median income families living in each county or school district. The correlations between upward\nmobility and these measures of public goods for low-income individuals are very similar to those reported in Table\nVII because expenditures in low-income areas are very highly correlated with mean expenditures at the CZ level.\n39CZs,thecorrelationbetweenabsoluteupwardmobilityis0.32. Wefindarobustpositivecorrelation\nbetween tax rates and upward mobility across the specifications in Table VII.41\nAn alternative measure of local public good provision is total local government expenditure.\nTax revenue differs from local government expenditure because of inter-governmental transfers. We\ndefine mean local government expenditure as total expenditure at the county or lower level divided\nby household income in the CZ in 1990. The correlation between government expenditure and\nupward mobility is also positive, but it is smaller than that between local tax rates and upward\nmobility. This could potentially be because local tax rates are used primarily to finance schools,\nwhich may have a larger impact on upward mobility than expenditures funded by other sources of\nrevenue.\nNext, we evaluate whether areas that provide more transfers to low-income families through the\ntax system exhibit greater upward mobility. We use two state-level proxies for the progressivity of\nlocal tax policy. The first is the size of the state Earned Income Tax Credit. State EITC programs\narethelargeststate-levelcashtransferforlowincomeearners. BecausestateEITCpolicieschanged\nsignificantly over the period when children in our sample were growing up, we define a measure\nof mean exposure to the state EITC as the mean state EITC rate between 1981 and 2001, when\nthe children in our sample were between the ages of 0 and 20.42 The mean state EITC rate is\npositively correlated with upward mobility, with a correlation of approximately 0.25 that is fairly\nrobust across specifications. Our second proxy for the progressivity of the local tax code is the\ndifference between the top state income tax rate and the state income tax rate for individuals with\ntaxableincomeof$20,000in2008basedondatafromtheTaxFoundation. Thereisaweakpositive\ncorrelation between local tax progressivity and upward mobility across the various specifications in\nTable VII, but the correlation is not statistically significant.\nInsummary,wefindthatareasthatprovidemorelocalpublicgoodsandlargertaxcreditsforlow\nincome families tend to have higher levels of upward mobility. However, segregation and inequality\nare much stronger and more robust predictors of the variation in intergenerational mobility than\ndifferences in local tax and expenditure policies.\n41We drop one small CZ (Barrow, AK) in which local government revenue exceeds mean income. We analogously\nexcludetwooutlierCZsinAlaskainwhichlocalgovernmentexpenditureexceeds50%ofincomewhenanalyzingthe\ncorrelation with local government expenditure below.\n42We assign state-years without a state EITC a rate of 0 when computing this mean. See Online Appendix D for\nfurther details on the computation of state EITC rates.\n40V.E School Quality\nThe local public good that may have the most direct impact on children’s outcomes is the quality\nof local schools (e.g., Card and Krueger 1992). We study the correlation between mobility and\nvarious proxies for school quality in the fourth panel of Figure X and Table VII.\nWe begin by analyzing mean public school expenditures per student, based on data from the\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for the 1995-1996 fiscal year. The correlation\nbetween public school expenditures and upward mobility is roughly similar to that between local\ntaxratesandupwardmobility,whichistobeexpectedgiventhatlocaltaxrevenueisusedprimarily\nto fund schools.43\nSince expenditures are not necessarily a good measure of the quality of education (Hanushek\n1989), we next turn to one easily measurable input into the education production function: class\nsize. Prior work has demonstrated that class size has causal effects on student achievement and\nlong-term outcomes (Krueger 1999, Chetty et al. 2011, Fredriksson et al. 2013). We obtain data\non mean student-teacher ratios from the NCES for the 1996-1997 school year.44 When pooling all\nCZs, there is a strong negative correlation between class size and upward mobility (Columns 1 and\n2 of Table VII). However, there is no correlation between upward mobility and class size in more\nurban areas (Columns 3 and 4).\nOne shortcoming of input-based measures of school quality is that they capture relatively little\nof the variation in the true quality of schools (e.g., Hanushek 2003). One common approach to\naddressing this problem is to use output-based measures of quality, such as the value-added of\nteachers. We construct simple output-based proxies for school quality based on test scores and\ndropout rates adjusted for differences in parent income. We obtain data on mean grade 3-8 math\nand English test scores by CZ from the Global Report Card, which converts scores on state-level\ntests to a national scale to generate test score measures by school district on a single scale. We\nobtain data on high school dropout rates from the NCES for the 2000-2001 school year, restricting\nthe sample to CZs in which at least 75% of school districts have non-missing data. We regress test\nscores on mean parent family income (from 1996-2000) in the core sample and compute residuals to\nobtain an income-adjusted measure of test score gains. We construct an income-adjusted measure\nof dropout rates analogously.\n43We drop observations in the top 1% of the distribution of expenditures per student to reduce the influence of\noutliers.\n44We drop observations where the mean reported class size is 0 or above 100.\n41Theincome-adjustedtestscoreanddropoutratesareveryhighlycorrelatedwithupwardmobil-\nity across all specifications, as shown in the fourth panel of Figure X and Table VII. In the baseline\nspecification(Column1ofTableVII),themagnitudeofthecorrelationbetweenbothmeasuresand\nupward mobility is nearly 0.6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the quality of\nschools–asjudgedbyoutputsratherthaninputs–playsaroleinupwardmobility. Ataminimum,\nthey strengthen the view that much of the difference in intergenerational income mobility across\nareas emerges while children are relatively young.\nV.F Access to Higher Education\nHaving found a correlation between measures of the quality of local public schools and upward\nmobility, we now turn to higher education. We construct three measures of local access to higher\neducationusingdatafromtheIntegratedPostsecondaryEducationDataSystem(IPEDS).Thefirst\nmeasure is the number of Title IV, degree-granting colleges per capita in the CZ in 2000, which is\nsimilar to the distance-based instrument used by Card (1993). The second measure is the mean\n(enrollment-weighted) tuition sticker price for in-state, full-time undergraduates for colleges in the\nCZ, which reflects the affordability of local higher education. The third measure is the residual\nfrom an OLS regression of the mean (enrollment-weighted) graduation rate from colleges in the CZ\non mean parent family income in the CZ, a rough proxy for the output of local higher education.\nThe correlations between all three of these measures – shown in the fifth panel of Figure X and\nTable VII – are small and typically statistically insignificant. We also evaluated several additional\nmeasures of access to higher education, including the mean value of institutional grants to students\nenrolled in colleges in the CZ, the number of low-cost (below the national median) colleges per\ncapita in the CZ, and the mean distance to the nearest low-cost college. We found no significant\nrelationship between any of these measures and our measures of intergenerational mobility (not\nreported).\nWe conclude that very little of the spatial variation in intergenerational mobility is explained\nby differences in local access to higher education. Of course, this finding does not imply that\ncollege does not play a role in upward mobility. Indeed, areas with greater upward mobility tend to\nhave high college attendance rates for children from low-income families (Figure VIIIa), suggesting\nthat attending college is an important pathway for moving up in the income distribution. The\npoint here is simply that the characteristics of local colleges are not a strong predictor of children’s\nsuccess, perhaps because the marginal impact of improving local access to higher education on\n42college attendance and later outcomes is small.\nV.G Labor Market Structure\nSome analysts have suggested that the availability of certain types of jobs (e.g., manufacturing)\nmay provide ladders for lower-skilled workers to move up in the income distribution (e.g., Wilson\n1996). To explore this possibility, we measure various characteristics of the local labor market: (1)\nthe overall employment rate in the local labor market in 2000, (2) the fraction of workers employed\nin the manufacturing industry, and (3) a measure of exposure to import competition based on the\ngrowth in Chinese imports per worker from Autor et al. (2013). As shown in the sixth panel of\nFigure X and Table VII, all of these characteristics are weakly correlated with the variation in\nupward mobility, with little evidence of a clear, robust relationship across specifications. We also\nfind no significant correlation with other indicators such as the fraction of workers employed in\nmanagement or professional occupations or industry establishment shares (not reported).\nOnelabormarketindicatorthatisstronglycorrelatedwithupwardmobilityistheteenagelabor\nforce participation rate. We measure the teenage labor force participation rate as the fraction of\nchildrenwhohaveaW-2betweentheagesof14-16inthe1985-87birthcohorts, theearliestcohorts\nforwhichW-2 dataare available atage 14in thetax data. Theunweightedcorrelation between the\nteenage labor force participation rate and absolute upward mobility is 0.629, and this correlation is\nhighlyrobustacrossspecifications. Thiscouldbebecauseformaljobshelpdisadvantagedteenagers\ndirectly or because areas with good schools and other characteristics tend to have more teenagers\nworking in the formal sector. In either case, this finding mirrors the general pattern documented\nabove: the strongest predictors of upward mobility are factors that affect children well before they\nenter the labor force as adults.\nV.H Migration Rates\nA large literature has evaluated whether immigration rates are related to labor market outcomes\n(e.g., Altonji and Card 1989, Borjas et al. 1997). Here we evaluate whether there is a correlation\nbetween migration rates and children’s outcomes.\nWe consider three measures of the extent to which a CZ is integrated with other labor markets:\n(1) the migration inflow rate, defined as the number of people who move into the CZ between\n2004 and 2005 based on IRS Statistics of Income migration data divided by the CZ population in\n2000 based on Census data, (2) the migration outflow rate, defined as the number of people who\n43move out of the CZ between 2004 and 2005 divided by population in 2000, and (3) the fraction of\nforeign-born individuals living in the CZ based on the 2000 Census.\nThe correlations between all three of these measures – shown in the seventh panel of Figure X\nandTableVII–aregenerallyquitelowandstatisticallyinsignificant. Inthefirsttwospecifications,\nmigrationratesarenegativelycorrelatedwithupwardmobility, butinthepopulation-weightedand\nurban-area specifications, there are no significant relationships.\nV.I Social Capital\nSeveral studies have emphasized the importance of social capital – the strength of social networks\nand engagement in community organizations in local areas – for social and economic outcomes\n(e.g., Coleman 1988, Borjas 1992, Putnam 1995). We explore the relationship between mobility\nand measures of social capital used in prior work in the eighth panel of Figure X and Table VII.\nOur primary proxy for social capital is the social capital index constructed by Rupasingha\nand Goetz (2008) and employed by Putnam (2007), which we aggregate to the CZ level using\npopulation-weighted means. This index is comprised of voter turnout rates, the fraction of people\nwho return their census forms, and various measures of participation in community organizations\nin the area. We find a strong positive correlation between upward mobility and social capital of\n0.641 in the baseline specification, an estimate that is quite robust across specifications.45\nWe also consider two other proxies for social capital: the fraction of religious individuals (based\non data from the Association of Religion Data Archives) and the rate of violent crime (using data\nfrom the Uniform Crime Report). Religiosity is very strongly positively correlated with upward\nmobility, while crime rates are negatively correlated with mobility.\nV.J Family Structure\nMany have argued that family stability plays a key role in children’s outcomes (see e.g., Becker\n1991, Murray 1984, Murray 2012). To evaluate this hypothesis, we use three measures of family\nstructure in the CZ based on data from the 2000 Census: (1) the fraction of children living in\nsingle-parent households, (2) the fraction of adults who are divorced, and (3) the fraction of adults\nwho are married. All three of these measures are very highly correlated with upward mobility\nacross all the specifications we consider, as shown in the ninth panel of Figure X and Table VII.\n45Interestingly,oneoftheoriginalmeasuresproposedbyPutnam(1995)–thenumberofbowlingalleysinanarea\n– has an unweighted correlation of 0.562 with our measures of absolute upward mobility.\n44The fraction of children living in single-parent households is the strongest correlate of upward\nincome mobility among all the variables we explored, with a raw unweighted correlation of -0.76\n(see Online Appendix Figure VIIa for the corresponding non-parametric binned scatter plot). One\nnatural explanation for this spatial correlation is an individual-level effect: children raised by a\nsingle parent may have worse outcomes than those raised by two parents (e.g., Thomas and Sawhill\n2002, Lamb 2004). To test whether this individual-level effect drives the spatial correlation, we\ncalculate upward mobility in each CZ based only on the subsample of children whose own parents\nare married. The correlation between upward mobility and the fraction of single parents in their\nCZ remains at -0.66 even in this subgroup (Online Appendix Figure VIIb). Hence, family structure\ncorrelates with upward mobility not just at the individual level but also at the community level,\nperhaps because the stability of the social environment affects children’s outcomes more broadly.\nThe association between mobility and family structure at the community level echoes our findings\nin Section V.A on the community-level effects of racial shares.\nV.K Comparison of Alternative Explanations\nThe five factors that exhibit the strongest and most robust correlations with integenerational mo-\nbility are (1) segregation, (2) income inequality, (3) school quality, (4) social capital, and (5) family\nstructure. We conclude our analysis by assessing which of these factors are the strongest predictors\nof upward mobility in multiple variable regressions.\nTable IX reports estimates from regressions of absolute upward mobility or relative mobility\non our preferred proxies for these five factors: the Theil index of racial segregation, the bottom\n99% Gini coefficient, high school dropout rates adjusted for income differences, the social capital\nindex, and the fraction of children with single parents. As in preceding regression specifications,\nthe dependent and independent variables are normalized to have a standard deviation of 1 in the\nestimation sample in each regression in Table IX.46\nWe begin in Column 1 with an unweighted OLS regression of absolute upward mobility y¯\n25,c\non the five factors, pooling all CZs. All of the factors except the Gini coefficient are significant\npredictors of the variation in absolute upward mobility in this specification. Together, the five\nfactors explain 70% of the variance in upward mobility across areas. Column 2 shows that the\ncoefficients remain similar when state fixed effects are included. Column 3 reports population-\n46We code the high school dropout rate as 0 for 126 CZs in which dropout rate data are missing for more than\n25% of the districts in the CZ and include an indicator for having a missing high school dropout rate. We do the\nsamefor16CZsthathavemissingdataonsocialcapital. Wenormalizethesevariablestohavemean0andstandard\ndeviation 1 among the CZs with non-missing data.\n45weighted estimates, while Column 4 restricts the sample to urban areas (CZs that intersect MSAs)\nand reports unweighted estimates. The estimates in Columns 3 and 4 remain roughly similar to\nthose in Columns 1 and 2, although the overall R-squared of the explanatory factors is lower in\nlarge cities. Across all the specifications, the strongest and most robust predictor is the fraction of\nchildren with single parents.\nIn Column 5, we use relative mobility β as the dependent variable instead of absolute upward\nc\nmobility. The fraction of single-parents and the racial segregation index are strong predictors of\ndifferences in relative mobility across areas, but the other factors are not statistically significant.\nTo understand why this is the case, in Column 6 we replicate Column 5 but exclude the fraction\nofchildrenwithsingleparents. Inthisspecification, allfouroftheremainingfactors–includingthe\nGini coefficient – are strong predictors of the variation in relative mobility across CZs. Column 7\nreplicates the specification in Column 6 using absolute upward mobility as the dependent variable.\nOnce again, all four factors are strong predictors of upward mobility when the fraction of single\nparents is excluded. These results suggest that the fraction of single parents may capture some of\nthe variation in the other factors, most notably the level of income inequality. Indeed, CZs with\ngreater inequality have significantly higher rates of single parenthood. Hence, the results in Table\nIX are consistent with the view that inequality affects children’s outcomes partly by degrading\nfamily structure and social ties in the community.\nThe last column of Table IX shows that when we regress absolute upward mobility on both\nthe fraction of single-parent families in the CZ and the share of black residents, black shares are\nno longer correlated with upward mobility. This result further supports the view that the strong\ncorrelation of upward mobility with race operates through channels beyond the direct effect of race\non mobility and demonstrates the tremendous explanatory power of the single-parent measure.\nOverall, the results in Table IX indicate that the differences in upward mobility across areas\nare better explained by a combination of the factors identified above rather than any single factor.\nHowever, the regression coefficients should be interpreted with caution for two reasons. First, all\nof our proxies reflect latent factors that are measured with error. Because of measurement error,\nthe regression may place greater weight on factors that are better measured rather than those\nthat are truly the strongest determinants of mobility. Second, all of the independent variables are\nendogenously determined. These limitations make it difficult to identify which of the factors is the\nmost important determinant of upward mobility.\n46VI Conclusion\nThis paper has used population-wide data to present a new portrait of intergenerational income\nmobility in the United States. Intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas. For\nexample, a child born in the bottom fifth of the income distribution has a 7.8% chance of reaching\nthe top fifth in the U.S. as a whole. But in some places, such as Salt Lake City and San Jose, the\nchance of moving from the bottom fifth to the top fifth is as high as 12.9%. In others, such as\nCharlotte and Indianapolis, it is as low as 4.4%. The spatial variation in intergenerational mobility\nis strongly correlated with five factors: (1) residential segregation, (2) income inequality, (3) school\nquality, (4) social capital, and (5) family structure.\nWhile we hope that these stylized facts will help guide the development of new models of inter-\ngenerational mobility, several important questions remain to be explored. Most importantly, the\ndescriptive analysis in this paper does not identify the causal mechanisms that drive the differences\nin upward mobility across areas. This question can be broken into two sub-questions. First, is\nthe variation in upward mobility across areas driven by sorting (differences in the characteristics\nof the residents) or causal place effects (differences in the institutions in an area)? Second, if place\nmatters, what specific policies lead to improvements in upward mobility? In ongoing work, Chetty\nand Hendren (2014) study the first question by focusing on individuals who move across areas. To\nfacilitate work on the second question, we have made our measures of upward and relative mobility\nas well as non-parametric quintile transition matrices and other CZ- and county-level statistics\npublicly available (www.equality-of-opportunity.org). For instance, these statistics could be used\nto study the impacts of place-based policies (Kline and Moretti 2014) on mobility.\nAnotherdimensioninwhichtheanalysisherecouldbeexpandedisbyanalyzingothermoments\nofthejointdistributionofparentandchildincome, suchaspersistenceatthetop(e.g., thetop1%)\nand the degree of downward mobility. The publicly available 100 x 100 percentile-level transition\nmatrices constructed here can be used to explore these questions.\nFinally,thispaperhaspresentedasnapshotofintergenerationalmobilityforasinglesetofbirth\ncohorts. In a companion paper (Chetty et al. 2014), we use smaller random samples to study time\ntrends in mobility. We find that the differences in mobility across areas documented here persist\nover time and are much larger than changes in mobility at the national level in recent decades.\nUnderstanding why some areas of the U.S. persistently generate higher rates of intergenerational\nmobility than others is an important challenge for future research.\n47ONLINE APPENDICES\nA. Data Construction\nCore and Extended Samples. We begin with the universe of individuals in the Death Master\n(also known as the Data Master-1) file produced by the Social Security Administration. This file\nincludes information on year of birth and gender for all persons in the United States with a Social\nSecurity Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. We restrict this sample to all\nindividuals who are current US citizens as of March 2013. The Data Master-1 file does not contain\nhistorical citizenship status and thus we can only restrict to a sample who are currently US citizens\nas of the time at which we access the data. We further restrict to individuals who are alive through\nthe end of 2012. The resulting dataset contains 47.8 million children across all cohorts 1980-1991\n(Appendix Table I).\nFor each child, we define the parent(s) as the first person(s) who claim the child as a dependent\non a 1040 tax form. If parents are married but filing separately, we assign the child both parents.\nTo eliminate dependent claiming by siblings or grandparents, in the case of a potential match to\nmarried parents or single mothers, we require the mother to be age 15-40 at birth.47 In the case of\na match to a single father, we require the father to be age 15-40 at birth. If no such eligible match\noccurs in 1996, the first year of our data, we search subsequent years (through 2011) until a valid\nmatch is found.\nOnce we match a child to parent(s), we hold this definition of parents fixed regardless of sub-\nsequent dependent claims or changes in marital status. For example, a child matched to married\nparentsin1996whodivorcein1997willalwaysbematchedtothetwooriginalparents. Conversely,\na child matched to a single parent in 1996 that marries in 1997 will be considered matched to a\nsingle parent, though spouse income will be included in our definition of parent income because we\nmeasure parent income at the family level in our baseline analysis.\nWe measure parent and child income, location, college attendance, and all other variables using\ndata from the IRS Databank, a balanced panel covering all individuals in the United States who\nappearonanytaxformbetween1996-2012. Toreducetheeffectsofoutliersandmeasurementerror\nin the upper tail of the income distribution, we use data from the IRS Statistics of Income (SOI)\nmanually perfected cross-sectional files spanning 1996-2011 (see below for details on these files).\nThe probability of being in the SOI sample increases with income, and approaches 1 for the highest\nincome individuals or those whose adjusted gross income exceeds $5 million. If an individual’s\nadjusted gross income exceeds $10 million, we look for the individual in the SOI sample; if present,\nwe use the SOI measure of adjusted gross income and wage income as reported on a F1040 return.\nIf not, we replace the adjusted gross income with the total wages reported on the filed F1040\ncontained in the databank. This adjustment affects 0.017% of parents in our core sample (or,\nequivalently, 1.7% of parents in the top 1% of the income distribution). Because the IRS Databank\nincludes tax year 2012 whereas the SOI sample does not, we top code income at $100 million for\nall individuals in 2012.\nStatistics of Income Sample. Starting in 1987, the IRS Statistics of Income cross sections –\nwhich are stratified random samples of tax returns – contain dependent information, allowing us\n47Children can be claimed as a dependent only if they are aged less than 19 at the end of the year (less than 24 if\nenrolled as a student) or are disabled. A dependent child is a biological child, step child, adopted child, foster child,\nbrotherorsister,oradescendantofoneofthese(forexample,agrandchildornephew). Childrenmustbeclaimedby\ntheir custodial parent, i.e. the parent with whom they live for over half the year. Furthermore, the custodial parent\nmust provide more than 50% of the support to the child. Hence, working children who support themselves for more\nthan 50% cannot be claimed as dependents. See IRS Publication 501 for further details.\n48to link children to parents. We use the 1987-2011 SOI cross-sections to construct a sample of\nchildren born in the 1971-1991 birth cohorts and correct for errors in the upper tail of the income\ndistribution as described above. For each SOI cross-section from 1987 to 2007, we first identify\nall dependent children between the ages of 12 and 16 who are alive at age 30. We then pool all\nthe SOI cross-sections that give us information for a given birth cohort. For example, the 1971\ncohort is represented by children claimed at age 16 in 1987, while the 1991 cohort is comprised by\nchildren claimed at ages 12-16 in 2003-2007. Using the sampling weights for the SOI cross-sections\n(see Internal Revenue Service (2013) for details), each cohort-level dataset is representative of the\npopulation of children claimed on tax returns between the ages of 12 and 16 in that birth cohort.\nUnlike in the population-based samples, we do not limit the SOI sample to children who are\ncurrently citizens because citizenship data are not fully populated for birth cohorts prior to 1980\nand because we begin from a sample of children claimed by parents rather than the universe of\nchildren who currently appear in the population data (which includes later immigrants). In the\nyears where the SOI and population-based samples overlap, we obtain very similar estimates in\nboth samples. The citizenship restriction has a minor impact because the vast majority of children\nclaimed as dependents between the ages of 12-16 are U.S. citizens as adults. We also do not impose\nany age restrictions on the parents in the SOI sample. In the population-based sample, some\nchildren are claimed by different adults across years and the age restriction is useful to discriminate\nbetween these potential parents. In the SOI sample, each child can only be linked to the parents\nwho claim her in the cross-section file, so the age restriction would not play such a role. In practice,\nthis restriction has little impact, as the age distribution of parents in the SOI sample is very similar\nto that in the core sample using the population data.\nChildren whose parents are sampled in multiple SOI cross-sections appear multiple times in the\nSOI sample. There are 228,295 unique children in the SOI sample and 523,700 total observations.\nTheSOIsamplegrowsfrom4,383uniquechildrenin1971to21,231uniquechildrenin1991because\nwe have more cross-sections to link parents to children in more recent cohorts and because the size\nof the SOI cross-sections has increased over time (Appendix Table II). To be consistent with the\ncore sample definition of parent income, we define parent income as the 5-year average of parent\nfamily income from 1996-2000 in the IRS Databank.\nWe provide additional information on the SOI sample in Chetty et al. (2014). Using sampling\nweights,weshowthattheSOIsamplerepresentsroughly85%ofchildrenineachbirthcohort(based\nonvitalstatisticscounts)from1971-1979,thecohortsweusetoobtainestimatesofintergenerational\nmobility after age 32 in Figure IIIa. We also show that summary statistics for the SOI sample are\nvery similar to the core sample for the 1980-82 birth cohorts reported in Table I of this paper.\nNote that Chetty et al. (2014) compute parent income using the income of the parents in the single\nyear of the parent-child match there, whereas we compute parent income as the five-year average\nover 1996-2000 here for consistency with results from the population data. Because we restrict to\nparents with positive income, this leads to a small difference in the SOI sample used across the two\npapers. For example, we have 4,384 children in the 1971 cohort, compared with 4,331 children in\nthe sample used by Chetty et al. (2014).\nAssignment of Children to Commuting Zones. Children are assigned ZIP codes of residence\nbased on their parents’ ZIP code on the form 1040 in which the parent is matched to the child. In\nthe few cases where a parent files a F1040 claiming the child but does not report a valid ZIP code,\nwe search information returns (such as W-2 and 1099-G forms) for a valid ZIP code in that year.\nWe map these ZIP codes to counties based on the 1999 Census crosswalk between ZIP codes\nand counties. We then aggregate counties into Commuting Zones using David Dorn’s county-to-CZ\ncrosswalk (download file E6). The counties in the U.S. Census Bureau crosswalk and in David\nDorn’s crosswalk are not identical because they correspond to county definitions at different points\n49in time; in particular the U.S. Census Bureau crosswalk includes changes between 1990 and 1999.\nWe make manual adjustments for changes that affected 200 or more people. Using this procedure,\nwe identify the CZ of 38,839 ZIP codes. To better track individuals residing in ZIP codes that\nhave been created since 1999, we add an additional 477 ZIP codes not valid in 1999 but appearing\nin the more up-to-date 2011 HUD-USPS crosswalk. For example, in 2007, Manhattan’s ZIP code\n10021 was split into three separate ZIP codes, resulting in the creation of new ZIP codes 10065 and\n10075.\nOf 9,864,965 children with non-missing ZIP codes in our core sample, 9,778,071 were assigned a\nchildhood CZ using ZIP codes that existed in 1999; an additional 2,718 were assigned a CZ based\nonaZIPcodethatexistedin2011butnotin1999. Forsimplicity, weusethesamecrosswalkforall\nyears of matching ZIP codes to CZs. We have verified that using year-specific crosswalks from ZIP\ncodes to counties has a negligible effect on CZ assignments. All of the crosswalks we constructed\nare available on our project website.\nSome of our specifications require tracking children’s locations into adulthood using the ZIP\ncode where they live as adults when we measure their income (e.g., for cost-of-living adjustments).\nWe define a child’s adult location using the latest non-missing ZIP code. We first search for a\nzipcode in their 1040 form in 2012, followed by their information returns in 2012. We then repeat\nthis procedure for 2011 if we do not find a zipcode in 2012. This yields 9,834,975 non-missing child\nZIP codes in adulthood. Of these, we match 9,537,283 to a CZ from a ZIP code using the 1999\ncrosswalk (i.e. this zipcode was in use in 1999) and an additional 198,317 using the later crosswalk\nbecause the ZIP code was created after 1999.\nConstruction of ZIP-Level Racial Shares. To construct Figure IXb and IXc, which condition\non racial shares at the ZIP level, we need data on racial shares by ZIP code. The 2000 Census\nincludes summary tables by ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) instead of ZIP code. ZCTAs are\na U.S. Census Bureau geographical unit that in most cases correspond closely to ZIP codes, but\nsometimes do not. We use a ZCTA to ZIP Crosswalk from the John Snow Institute to assign each\nZIP code a racial share based on Census 2000 ZCTA-level data from form P008.\nCZ-Level Price Index. To measure real incomes, we first construct a CZ-level ACCRA price\nindex using the 2010 ACCRA composite cost of living index (table 728) for “urbanized areas”\nin 2010, which we crosswalk to CZs as follows. First, we use the 2012Q1-2013Q1 correspondence\n(downloaded on 11/21/2013) to assign 298 out of the 325 urbanized areas to MSAs. Each county in\nan MSA was assigned the same value of the index. We then merge counties to CZs and calculate an\nunweighted mean of the index among non-missing values within the CZ. Some CZs had no counties\nwithin an MSA and were therefore assigned a missing value of the ACCRA index.\nTo construct a price index that covers all CZs, we regress the CZ-level ACCRA index on a\nquadratic in log population density (from the 2000 Census), a quadratic in log median housing\nvalues, the latitude and longitude of the CZ centroid, and state fixed effects. Housing values are\nthe population-weighted mean of tract median housing values for owner-occupied units in the 1990\nCensus short form. Latitude and longitude are the mean latitude and longitude across counties\nwithin each CZ, obtained from the Census 2000 Gazetteer county-level data. The predicted values\nfrom this regression constitute our final price index that covers all CZs.\nB. Comparison to Survey Datasets\nInAppendixTableIII,wecompareselectedmomentsofincomedistributionsandothervariables\nin the tax data to data from two nationally representative surveys that have been used in prior\nwork on the income distribution: the 2011-12 CPS and the 2011-12 ACS. We restrict the ACS and\nCPS samples to citizens in the same birth cohorts as our core sample (1980-82). To the extent\npossible, we define all income variables to match the concepts in the tax data.\n50Toassesswhetherourmethodoflinkingchildrentoparentsbasedondependentclaimingcreates\nselection bias, we compute statistics in the tax data both on the full sample of all children in the\n1980-82birthcohortswhoarecurrentU.S.citizensandthecoresampleofchildrenlinkedtoparents.\nBecause most children are linked to parents, the differences between these two samples are small,\nthough children who lack valid parent matches have slightly lower earnings on average.\nOverall, the tax data are very similar to the CPS and ACS. The sum of the sampling weights\nin our survey -based samples provide estimates of the size of the target population being sampled.\nThispopulationisverysimilarinthetaxdataandthetwosurveys. Themeanandmedianearnings\nlevels are very similar, as are the fractions with non-zero income. Perhaps more surprisingly, the\ninterquartile range (P75-P25) of earnings is also similar across the three data sources. If survey\ndata were reported with classical measurement error, we would expect the interquartile range to be\nlarger in survey sources. However, survey reports of income exhibit “mean reverting” measurement\nerror which has the effect of reducing variability (Bound and Krueger 1991; Bound et al. 2001).\nMoreover, survey non-response tends to follow a U-shaped pattern (Kline and Santos 2013), with\nvery high and low earning individuals being least likely to provide earnings responses, which can\nfurther reduce variability. The quantiles of family income also line up well across the three data\nsources, with the tax-based moments strongly resembling those from the ACS, perhaps because the\nACS has a higher response rate for earnings than the CPS.\nC. Comparison to Mazumder (2005)\nMazumder (2005) reports that even 5-year averages of parent earnings exhibit substantial at-\ntenuation bias because of long-lasting transitory shocks to income. This appendix provides further\ndetails on why we find much less attenuation bias than Mazumder.\nMazumder (2005, Table 4, row 1, page 246) obtains IGE estimates as high as 0.6 when using\n15-year averages of parent income matched SIPP-SSA administrative data, 54% larger than his 4-\nyear pooled estimate of 0.388. In contrast, we find little difference between IGEs based on five-year\nvs. fifteen-year averages of parent income both using our preferred rank-rank specification (Figure\nIIIb) and using a log-log IGE specification similar to that estimated by Mazumder. In particular,\nwe obtain a log-log IGE of 0.366 using a 15-year average of parent family income, closer to the\nestimates of Solon (1992) than Mazumder’s estimates.\nWe believe our results differ from Mazumder’s findings because we directly observe income for\nall individuals in our data, whereas Mazumder imputes parent income based on race and education\nfor up to 60% of the observations in his sample to account for top-coding in social security records.\nThese imputations are analogous to instrumenting for parent income using race and education, an\napproach known to yield higher estimates of the IGE, perhaps because parents’ education directly\naffects children’s earnings (e.g., Solon, 1992, Zimmerman, 1992, Mulligan, 1997, Solon, 1999). Be-\ncause the SSA earnings limit is lower in the early years of his sample, Mazumder imputes income\nfor a larger fraction of observations when he averages parent income over more years (Mazumder\n2005, Figure 3). As a result, Mazumder’s estimates effectively converge toward IV estimates as he\nuses more years to calculate mean parent income, explaining why his estimates rise so sharply with\nthe number of years used to measure parent income. Consistent with this explanation, when he\ndrops imputed observations, his IGE estimates increase much less with the number of years used\nto measure parent income (Mazumder 2005, Table 6).\nMazumder also reports simulations of earnings processes showing that attenuation bias in the\nIGE should be substantial even when using five-year averages. However, he calibrates the param-\neters of the earnings process in his simulation based on estimates from survey data, which have\nmuch more noise than administrative records. If one replicates Mazumder’s simulations using a\n51smaller variance share for transitory shocks, one obtains results similar to ours in Figure IIIb, with\nlittle attenuation bias in estimates based on five-year averages.\nTo be clear, Mazumder himself acknowledges the potential bias due to imputation, as he rec-\nommends in his conclusion that “future research should attempt to verify the results here using\nlong-term measures of permanent earnings from other sources that do not require the kind of\nimputations that were necessary in this study.” Our analysis simply follows this recommendation.\nD. Construction of CZ-Level Covariates\nThis appendix supplements Online Data Table IX by providing further details about our CZ\ncovariates used in Section V. Online Data Table IX contains detailed descriptions of each CZ\ncovariate and briefly describes the source of data for each variable. Here, we provide additional\ndetails on each data source along with links to original sources. As a reference, we provide Stata\ncode on our website that constructs the final CZ-level covariates (data available in Online Data\nTable VIII) from the raw data downloaded from the links below.\nOur source data are primarily at the ZIP code and county level. We map ZIP codes and\ncounties to CZs using the procedure described in Appendix A. We compute CZ-level means of the\nZIP- and county-level data using population-weighted averages, with population counts from the\n2000 Census.\nRace and Segregation. Racial shares are calculated from the 2000 census short form (SF1) table\nP008. Note that all Census data can be obtained by searching for the relevant census table on the\nU.S. Census Bureau’s American FactFinder. The black share is defined as the number of people\nin a CZ that are black alone divided by the CZ population; the white share is calculated similarly.\nFor the Hispanic share, the numerator is the number of people of any race that are Hispanic. We\nalso calculate a residual category where the numerator is the number of people that are neither\nblack alone nor white alone nor Hispanic.\nWe calculate several indices of social and economic segregation. We compute the racial segrega-\ntion index using the census tract level data on racial shares from Table P008 from the 2000 Census.\nFor segregation of affluence and poverty, we use the sample data from the 2000 census long form\n(SF3) on the income distribution of households in 1999 by census tract contained in table P052.\nOur formulas for the three income segregation measures are taken directly from Reardon (2011).\nWe compute H(p ) for each of the 16 income groups given in table P052. We then estimate H(p )\nk 25\nand H(p ) in each CZ using the 4th order polynomial version of the weighted linear regression in\n75\nequation 12 on page 23 of Reardon (2011). The overall segregation of income index is Reardon’s\nrank-order index, which we compute from equation 13, where the δ vector is given in Appendix A4\nof Reardon (2011).\nTo compute the commute time variable, we divide the number of workers that commute for less\nthan 15 minutes by the total number of workers. The sample for both of these counts is restricted\nto workers that are at least 16 years old and do not work from home. Travel time data is from the\n2000 census table P031.\nIncome Distributions. We compute mean income per working age adult by dividing aggregate\nhousehold income in a CZ by the total number of people aged 16-64 in that CZ. These data come\nfrom the 2000 census table P054 and P008. The Gini coefficient, fraction middle class, and top 1%\nincome share are computed using our sample of parents and the family income definitions used for\nthe main analysis in this paper, but with family income top coded at $100 million in all years.\nTaxes and Government Expenditures. We estimate local tax rates using data on tax revenue\nby county from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 1992 Census of Government county-level summaries,\nwhich we downloaded from the ICPSR. In particular, Part 2 of the ICPSR download contains\n52the county-level summaries. We define the tax rate in each CZ as follows. First, we calculate\ncounty tax revenue divided by the county population estimate for each county in the CZ. We\nthen take a population-weighted mean across these counties to obtain a CZ-level mean per-person\ntaxes. Finally, we divide mean per-person taxes by the Census 2000 estimate of nominal income\nper household from 2000 census table P052. We code the tax rate as missing for one CZ (Barrow,\nAlaska), which has a calculated tax rate that exceeds 1.\nWe compute total government spending per capita in each county using Census data on govern-\nment expenditures by aggregating all county-level total expenditure categories and dividing by the\n1992 county population estimates. We then construct a CZ-level measure by taking population-\nweighted means of expenditures per capita in the counties in each CZ. We code local government\nexpenditures as missing for two CZs (Barrow, Alaska and Kotzebue, Alaska), which have unusually\nhigh expenditures per capita that exceed 50% of per capita income.\nWe measure state income tax progressivity as the difference between 2008 state income tax\nrates for incomes above $100,000 and incomes in the bottom tax bracket using data from the Tax\nFoundation. We obtain data on State EITC rates by year from Hotz and Scholz (2003). We\ncalculate mean EITC rate for the years 1980-2001, setting the rate to zero for state-year pairs\nwhere there was no state EITC. Note that Wisconsin’s state EITC rate depends on the number of\nchildren in a household; we use the rate for households with two children.\nK-12 Education. We use the National Center for Education Statistics’ Common Core of Data\ndata for public schools for several of our K-12 covariates. School expenditures per student is taken\nfrom school-district data for the 1996-1997 fiscal year. We drop 7 CZs that are in the top 1% of\nthe distribution of expenditures per student to reduce the influence of outliers.\nWe use school-level data on student-teacher ratios for the 1996-1997 school year. We drop\nthe top 0.1% of observations, which have student-teacher ratios that exceed 100. We also drop\napproximately 10% of schools whose student-teacher ratios are recorded as being 0.\nHigh school dropout rates are obtained from school-district data for the 2000-2001 school year.\nWecodethedropoutrateasmissinginCZsinwhichmorethan25%ofschooldistrictshavemissing\ndata on dropout rates. We construct an income-adjusted measure of dropout rates using residuals\nfrom a CZ-level regression of the dropout rate on mean parent family income (from 1996-2000) in\nthe core sample.\nWeobtainastandardizedmeasureofgrade3-8testscoresfromtheNationalMathPercentileand\nNational Reading Percentile series in the Global Report Card. The Global Report Card constructs\nnationalmathandreadingscorepercentilesforeachschooldistrictbyfirstcalculatingthedistrict’s\nstate-levelz-scorefortheshareofstudentsinthedistrictscoringattheproficientlevelandaboveon\nstatewide standardized tests, then adjusting for the relative difficulty of achieving the proficiency\ncutoff in each state, and finally recentering the distribution of adjusted district z-scores for each\nstate at that state’s z-score for average student scores on the National Assessment of Education\nProgress Exam. We calculate the student-weighted mean of the math and reading rankings over\n2004, 2005, and 2007 in each CZ to arrive at our measure of mean test scores. We then construct a\nmeasure of income-adjusted test scores using the residual from a CZ-level regression of mean test\nscores on mean parent family income (from 1996-2000) in the core sample.\nWe construct enrollment-weighted means at the ZIP code level of all the school and school\ndistrict level variables using the school and district ZIP codes provided in each of the data sources.\nWe then take enrollment-weighted means across ZIP codes to construct CZ-level estimates using\nthe ZIP to CZ crosswalk discussed in Appendix A.\nHigher Education. We use the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to\nconstruct our three measures of college access and quality. We restrict the sample to Title IV\ninstitutions that have undergraduate students, and are degree offering. The number of colleges per\n53capita in each CZ is the number of institutions in the 2000 IPEDS in each CZ divided by the CZ\npopulation. We define college tuition as the mean in-state tuition and fees for first-time, full-time\nundergraduatesfortheinstitutionsineachCZ.Wedefinetheenrollment-weightedmeangraduation\nrate based on the 150% of normal time college graduation rate from IPEDS 2009, the first year for\nwhich this data is available. We construct a measure of income-adjusted graduation rates using the\nresidual from a CZ-level regression of graduation rates on mean parent income in the core sample.\nLocal Labor Market Conditions. The labor force participation rate is defined as the number of\npeople in the labor force by the total population in the sample of people that are at least 16 years\nold. These data are from the 2000 Census long form (SF3) in table P043. We compute the share\nof workers in manufacturing from the 2000 census in table P049; we divide the number of people\nworking in manufacturing by the total number of workers.\nThe exposure to Chinese trade variable is the percentage change in imports per worker from\nChina between 1990 and 2000. It is measured as the growth in imports allocated to a CZ, divided\nby the CZ work force in 1990 (with the growth rate defined as 10 times the annualized change).\nThis variable was constructed by Autor et al. (2013) and provided to us by David Dorn.\nThe teenage labor force participation rate is defined in each CZ as the share of individuals who\nreceived one or more W-2’s between the ages of 14 and 16. We calculate the teenage LFP rate\nusing W-2 data for the 1985-1987 birth cohorts, the earliest cohorts for which we have W2 data at\nage 14.\nMigration Rates. For inflow and outflow migration data, we use the county-to-county migration\ndatafromtheInternalRevenueService’sStatisticsofIncomefor2004-2005. Inflowmigrationisthe\nnumber of people moving into a CZ from counties in other CZs divided by the total CZ population;\noutflow migration is calculated similarly. We compute the share of each CZs population that is\nforeign born using sample data from the 2000 census (table P021) on the number of foreign born\ninhabitantsdividedbytotalCZpopulation. Inbothcases,totalCZpopulationisthesumofcounty\npopulations from the 2000 Census (table P008) over counties in the CZ.\nSocial Capital. For social capital, we use the 1990 county-level social capital index from Ru-\npasingha and Goetz (2008). For religious affiliation, we use data on the self-reported number of\nreligious adherents from the Association of Religion Data Archives at Pennsylvania State Univer-\nsity. Data on crime rates are from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. We downloaded\ncounty-level data from the ICPSR and use the number of arrests for serious (part 1 index) violent\ncrimes divided by the total covered population.\nFamily Structure. We define the share of single mothers in each county as the number of\nhouseholds with female heads (and no husband present) with own children present divided by the\ntotal number of households with own children present. These data from from the 2000 census long\nform (SF3) in table P015. We calculate the fraction married and fraction divorced in each county\nusing the number of people that are married or divorced (in the sample of people that are 15 years\nand older) using data from the 2000 census in table P018.\n54References\nAltonji, Joseph G. and David Card. 1989. “The Effects of Immigration on the Labor Market\nOutcomes of Natives.” NBER Working Paper 3123, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.\nAutor, David H., David Dorn, and Gordon H.

The regressions are run using data for the 709 CZs with at least 250 children in the core sample. The\ndependent variable in all columns is our baseline measure of absolute upward mobility, the expected rank of children\nwhoseparentsareatthe25thnationalpercentile.Allindependentanddependentvariablesarenormalized(intherelevant\nestimation sample) to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, so univariate regression coefficients equal correlation\ncoefficients. Column 2 and 5 restrict to the sample of CZs that intersect an MSA. Racial segregation is measured by the\nTheil index defined in equation (3) using racial shares at the census tract level. Income segregation is measured by a\nweighted average of two-group Theil indices, as in Reardon (2011); see equation (4). Segregation of poverty is a two-\ngroup Theil index, where the groups are defined as being above vs. below the 25th percentile of the local household\nincome distribution. Segregation of affluence is defined analogously at the 75th percentile. Share with commute <15\nminutes is the fraction of working individuals in each CZ who commute less than 15 minutes to work.TABLE VII\nCorrelates of Intergenerational Mobility Across Commuting Zones\nDep.

Both figures are based on the core sample (1980-82 birth cohorts) and baseline family income definitions for\nparents and children. Children are assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents (when the child was\nclaimed a dependent), irrespective of where they live as adults. Parent and child percentile ranks are always defined at the\nnational level, not the CZ level. To construct each series, we group parents into 50 equally sized (two percentile point) bins\nand plot the mean child percentile rank vs. the mean parent percentile rank within each bin. We report two measures of\nmobility based on the rank-rank relationships in each CZ. The first is relative mobility (y¯ −y¯ ), which is 100 times the\n100 0\nrank-rankslopeestimate.

Children are assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents (when the child was claimed a\ndependent), irrespective of where they live as adults. In each CZ, we regress child income rank on a constant and parent\nincome rank. Using the regression estimates, we define Absolute Upward Mobility (y¯ ) as the intercept + 25×(rank-rank\n25\nslope), which corresponds to the predicted child rank given parent income at the 25th percentile (see Figure V). We define\nrelativemobilityastherank-rankslope; thedifferencebetweentheoutcomesofthechildfromtherichestandpoorestfamily\nis 100 times this coefficient (y¯ −y¯ ).

Both figures are based on the core sample (1980-82 birth cohorts) and baseline family income definitions\nfor parents. Children are assigned to commuting zones based on the location of their parents (when the child was claimed a\ndependent), irrespective of where they live as adults. In Panel A, we regress an indicator for the child ever attending college\nbetween ages 18-21 on parents’ national income rank to estimate the slope by CZ, as shown in Figure IV at the national\nlevel. College attendance is defined by the presence of a 1098-T form filed by a college on behalf of the student.
