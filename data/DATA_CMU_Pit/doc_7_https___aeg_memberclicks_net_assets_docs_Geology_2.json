It is a 40 to 60 foot series of mostly\nreddish, greenish, and grayish claystone and shale, with mi-\nnor amounts of sandstone and siltstone that tend to weather\ndeeply on hillsides throughout southwestern Pennsylvania.\nClaystone is a low permeability, low strength rock with\nweakly connected pore space. Repeated weathering cycles\nand excessive pore pressure have a tendency to reduce the in-\nternal shear strength of this particular rock, which can lead to\nfailure. In addition, Conemaugh claystones contain minerals\nthat tend to expand in the presence of water (Pomeroy, 1982).\nThese red shales have been interpreted as a paleosol\nhorizon (ancient soil zone) on the Pennsylvanian delta by\nDonahue and Rollins (1974). They suggest that the red col-\nor and the claystone texture are similar to that of a laterite\nsoil weathering profile. Good exposures of the series can\ndisplay evidence of an ancient soil development with some\noccasional root casts and calcite-rich nodules.\nAllegheny Group / Pennsylvanian\nThe Allegheny Group underlies the Conemaugh with a\nthickness between 270 and 330 feet in western Pennsylvania\n(Edmunds et al., 1999) beginning at the top of the Upper Free-\nport Coal and extending to the base of the Brookville Coal.\nThis group consists largely of marine units and contains six\nmineable coals, referred to as the Upper Freeport Coal, Low-\nFigure 11.

Abrupt variations in the thickness of\nthe Pottsville of up to 100 feet have been observed in short\ndistances, with this variability mainly occurring in the basal\npart of the formation (McElroy, 2000). The formation has mi-\nnor marine limestones in northern Pennsylvania. Mining of\ncoal in the Pottsville is limited.

Coal beds underlie about 15,000 square\nmiles of the State (See Figure 24). All significant coal beds\nin Pennsylvania are of Pennsylvanian or Permian age. Prior\nto any mining, Pennsylvania contained over 75 billion tons\nof bituminous coal and almost 23 billion tons of anthracite\nand semianthracite coal (Edmunds, 1999a).\nEarly Coal Mining\nCoal was first mined commercially in the United States\nin 1745 near Richmond, Virginia. In 1760, British soldiers\nstarted mining the Pittsburgh Coal seam on Coal Hill (now\nMt. Washington) across the Monongahela River from Fort\nPitt (Figure 3). By 1800, only Pittsburgh and Richmond,\nVirginia were using coal to any extent for domestic purpos-\nes. In early 1807, a Mr. Cuming, traveling from Philadelphia\nto Pittsburgh, upon reaching Greensburg, PA wrote:\n“On entering Habach’s tavern, I was no little surprised to\nsee a fine coal fire, and I was informed that coal is the princi-\npal fuel of the country, fifty or sixty miles ‘round Pittsburgh’.\nIt is laid down at the doors here for six cents a bushel.”\nFigure 26. Example of Room and Pillar Mining\n(Eavenson, 1939)\n(Gray et al., 1974).\nIn Pittsburgh, 10 collieries (e.g. a coal mine with con-\nnected coal-processing structures) were working in Coal\nHill in 1837 (Eavenson, 1939) across the Monongahela\nRiver from the City. By 1865, coke produced from coal was\nincreasingly important in iron processing (Gregory, 1980).\nThere are few reports on coal and coke production before\n1870 and no accurate records until 1885 (Eavenson, 1942).\nMining Methods\nRoom and pillar mining originated as a method of ex-\ntracting as much coal as possible while still providing roof\ncontrol by means of coal pillars. During the 18th and 19th\ncenturies, mines were small hand-excavated operations un-\nder shallow cover using hillside adits to enter the coal seam.\nCoal was cheap and the spacing, size, and regularity of pil-\nlars were somewhat arbitrary (Figure 25). Coal pillars were\nleft in place as a matter of convenience and safety to the\nminers. Increased production by the mid- to late19th cen-\ntury brought mechanization and ventilation requirements to\nmines that necessitated a systematic arrangement of pillars,\nbut still resulted in considerable coal being left underground.\nMining often extended to where the overburden was only 25\nfeet thick. Early extraction ratios, the proportion of coal re-\nmoved, averaged 30 to 40 percent. Since coal deposits were\nwidespread and accessible, little effort was made to improve\nFigure 25.
