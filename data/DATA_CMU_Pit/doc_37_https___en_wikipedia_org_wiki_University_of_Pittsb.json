The university is composed of seventeen undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its\nurban\nPittsburgh campus, home to the university's central administration and around 28,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus includes various historic buildings that are part of the\nSchenley Farms Historic District\n, most notably its 42-story\nGothic revival\ncenterpiece, the\nCathedral of Learning\n. Pitt is a member of the\nAssociation of American Universities\nand is\nclassified\namong \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".\n[\n7\n]\nPitt traces its roots to the\nPittsburgh Academy\nfounded by\nHugh Henry Brackenridge\nin 1787. While the city was still on the\nedge of the American frontier\nat the time, Pittsburgh's rapid growth meant that a proper university was soon needed, and Pitt's charter was altered in 1819 to confer university status on it as the\nWestern University of Pennsylvania\n. After surviving two fires and several relocations, the university moved to its current location in Pittsburgh's\nOakland\nneighborhood, and by act of the state legislature was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966, when it became part of the\nCommonwealth System of Higher Education\n.\nThe campus is situated adjacent to the flagship medical facilities of its closely affiliated\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\n(UPMC) and its flagship hospital,\nUPMC Presbyterian\n, as well as the\nCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh\n,\nSchenley Park\n, and\nCarnegie Mellon University\n. The university also operates four undergraduate branch campuses in\nWestern Pennsylvania\n, located in\nBradford\n,\nGreensburg\n,\nJohnstown\n, and\nTitusville\n. In athletics, Pitt competes in\nDivision I\nof the\nNCAA\nas the\nPittsburgh Panthers\n, primarily as members of the\nAtlantic Coast Conference\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nHugh Henry Brackenridge\n, founder of Pittsburgh Academy, the precursor to the University of Pittsburgh\nMain article:\nHistory of the University of Pittsburgh\nFounding\n[\nedit\n]\nFounded by\nHugh Henry Brackenridge\nas\nPittsburgh Academy\nin 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the\nAllegheny Mountains\n.\n[\n8\n]\nThe school began as a preparatory school, presumably in a\nlog cabin\n, possibly as early as 1770\n[\n9\n]\nin Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.\n[\n10\n]\nBrackenridge obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania\non February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the\nConstitutional Convention\nin Philadelphia.\n[\n11\n]\n[\n12\n]\nA brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nThe small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.\n[\n15\n]\nWestern University of Pennsylvania\n[\nedit\n]\nThe university in 1833 at its location on 3rd Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh\nWithin a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school was named the\nWestern University of Pennsylvania\n, or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nin\nPhiladelphia\n.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the\nstate legislature's\ndesire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.\n[\n17\n]\nThe university's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the\nGreat Fire of 1845\nthat wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in\nTrinity Church\nuntil a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former\nHorne's\ndepartment store). Four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the university time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day\nCity-County building\n) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that\nSamuel Pierpont Langley\n, astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the\nSmithsonian Institution\n, was chosen as director of the\nAllegheny Observatory\nthat was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer,\nJames Keeler\n. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to\nAllegheny City\n(present-day\nNorth Side\n).\n[\n18\n]\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nThe university eventually found itself on a 10-acre (4.0 ha) site on the North Side's\nObservatory Hill\nat the location of its\nAllegheny Observatory\n. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the university (now the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine\n). By 1893, the university had graduated its first African-American,\nWilliam Hunter Dammond\n.\n[\n19\n]\nIn 1895 WUP established its School of Law, and\nAndrew Carnegie\nand\nGeorge Westinghouse\nwere elected to the board of trustees, where they joined\nAndrew Mellon\n, who had been elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the university in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the university.\n[\n20\n]\nDuring this period, university engineering professor\nReginald Fessenden\nwas conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at\nExposition Park\n, the university had its first undefeated football team.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\n[\n21\n]\nA new name and home\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nCathedral of Learning\n, the centerpiece of Pitt's campus and the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere\nCiting a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\nin the summer of 1908. During this time, the university had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the\nNorth Side\nand its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought 43 acres (17 ha) of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.\n[\n22\n]\nThe initial campus plan for the new location centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by\nHenry Hornbostel\nfor 30 buildings.\n[\n23\n]\nHowever, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only\nThaw Hall\nremains today. In the fall of 1909, the university became the first college to adopt the\npanther\nas its mascot.\n[\n24\n]\nIt was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor\nSamuel McCormick\n, again held off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick also led the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as beginning institutional support of athletics.\n[\n23\n]\nIn the 1920s, new university chancellor\nJohn Gabbert Bowman\ndeclared that he had a vision for a centerpiece \"tall building\" for the university. The 14-acre (5.7 ha) Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-\nGothic Revival\nplan that today comprises the\nCathedral of Learning\n,\nHeinz Memorial Chapel\n,\nStephen Foster Memorial\n, and\nClapp Hall\nbuildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by\nCharles Klauder\nfor the \"tall building\": an attention-getting 535-foot (163 m) tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the \"character that ought to be in an educated man.\" The building's \"parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness\" and it would \"unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.\" The cathedral is \"cut off\" flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors and by a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the\nGreat Depression\nintervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, began hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally impressive interior highlighted by a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m\n2\n) Gothic hall Commons Room with 52-foot-tall (16 m) arches currently surrounded by 31\nNationality Rooms\n.\nDevelopment of the polio vaccine\n[\nedit\n]\nJonas Salk\ndeveloped the first polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh.\nIn the early 20th century, epidemics of\npolio\nbegan to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospitals filled with patients in\niron lungs\n, and tens of thousands were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile,\nJonas Salk\nhad set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now\nSalk Hall\n. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the\nvaccine\ndeveloped by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nState relations to present day\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1966, Pitt was designated by\nPennsylvania\nas a\nstate-related\nuniversity. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($154.3 million in fiscal year 2016) covering about 7% of its operating budget,\n[\n27\n]\nand offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt retains independent control. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by\nHall of Fame\nrunning back\nTony Dorsett\nand continued success in the 1980s with players such as\nHall of Fame\nquarterback\nDan Marino\n. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of\norgan transplantation\nwas conducted by\nThomas Starzl\n, establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, chancellor\nWesley Posvar\nretired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million.\n[\n28\n]\nMark Nordenberg\nwas chancellor of the university from 1995 to 2014 and led Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over three quarters of the way toward achieving its goal\n[\n29\n]\nand a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.\n[\n30\n]\nMajor initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the\nPetersen Events Center\n, a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\nand the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series of\ndisruptive bomb threats\nthat occurred in 2012.\nPatrick D. Gallagher\nwas named the 18th chancellor of the university and assumed the office on August 1, 2014.\n[\n31\n]\nCampus\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nPittsburgh Athletic Association\nbuilding, one of several Pitt buildings listed on the\nNational Register of Historic Places\n, is pictured to the left of\nAlumni Hall\n, both\nBenno Janssen\ndesigned buildings that are examples of\nRenaissance Revival\nand\nGreek Revial\narchitecture, respectively.\nThe University of Pittsburgh's main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53 km\n2\n) located in Pittsburgh's historic\nOakland\nneighborhood. Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story\nCathedral of Learning\n, falls within the\nOakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District\n.\n[\n32\n]\ncontains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIt has been termed \"a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present.\"\n[\n33\n]\nThe University of Pittsburgh's main campus contains four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes,\nresidence halls\n); mid (\nBenedum\n,\nChevron\n,\nAllen\nand\nThaw Halls\n); lower (\nCathedral of Learning\n,\nUnion\n,\nPosvar Hall\n); and on the west end of campus, the\nmedical center complex\n.

Legally, however, the university remains a private entity, operating under its nonprofit corporate charter, governed by its independent Board of Trustees, and with its assets under its own ownership and control.
