Descended from the\nPittsburgh Gazette\n, established in 1786 as the first newspaper published west of the\nAllegheny Mountains\n, the paper formed under its present title in 1927 from the consolidation of the\nPittsburgh Gazette Times\nand\nThe Pittsburgh Post\n.\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nended daily print publication in 2018 and has cut down to two print editions per week (Sunday and Thursday), going\nonline-only\nthe rest of the week.\nIn the 2010s, the editorial tone of the paper shifted from\nliberal\nto\nconservative\n, particularly after the editorial pages of the paper were consolidated in 2018 with\nThe Blade\nof\nToledo, Ohio\n. After the consolidation, Keith Burris, the pro-\nTrump\neditorial page editor of\nThe Blade\n, directed the editorial pages of both papers.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n2\n]\nCopies are sold for $4 daily (Thursdays) and $6 Sundays/Thanksgiving Day in-state.

As one of its first major articles, the\nGazette\npublished the newly adopted\nConstitution of the United States\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIn 1820, under publishers Eichbaum and Johnston and editor Morgan Neville, the name changed to\nPittsburgh Gazette and Manufacturing and Mercantile Advertiser\n.\n[\n6\n]\nDavid MacLean bought the paper in 1822, and later reverted to the former title.\n[\n7\n]\nUnder editor\nNeville B. Craig\n, whose service lasted from 1829 to 1841, the\nGazette\nchampioned the\nAnti-Masonic\nmovement. Craig turned the\nGazette\ninto the city's first daily paper, issued every afternoon except Sunday starting on July 30, 1833.\n[\n8\n]\nIn 1844, shortly after absorbing the\nAdvocate\n, the\nGazette\nswitched its daily issue time to morning.\n[\n9\n]\nIts editorial stance at the time was conservative and strongly favoring the\nWhig Party\n.\n[\n10\n]\nBy the 1850s the Gazette was credited with helping to organize a local chapter of the new\nRepublican Party\n, and with contributing to the election of\nAbraham Lincoln\n.\nThe paper was one of the first to suggest tensions between North and South would erupt in war.\n[\n11\n]\nAfter consolidating with the\nCommercial\nin 1877, the paper was again renamed and was then known as the\nCommercial Gazette\n.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 1900,\nGeorge T. Oliver\nacquired the paper, merging it six years later with\nThe Pittsburg Times\nto form\nThe Gazette Times\n.\n[\n13\n]\nPost\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Pittsburgh\nPost\nfirst appeared on September 10, 1842, as the\nDaily Morning Post\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIt had its origin in three pro-\nDemocratic\nweeklies, the\nMercury\n,\nAllegheny Democrat\n, and\nAmerican Manufacturer\n, which came together through a pair of mergers in the early 1840s.\n[\n15\n]\nThe three papers had for years engaged in bitter editorial battles with the\nGazette\n.\n[\n16\n]\nLike its predecessors, the\nPost\nadvocated the policies of the Democratic Party. Its political opposition to the\nWhig\nand later\nRepublican\nGazette\nwas so enduring that an eventual combination of the two rivals would have seemed unlikely.\n[\n17\n]\nBlock-Hearst deal\n[\nedit\n]\nThe 1920s were a time of consolidation in the\nPittsburgh\nnewspaper market. In 1923, local publishers banded together to acquire and kill off the\nDispatch\nand\nLeader\n. Four years later,\nWilliam Randolph Hearst\nnegotiated with the Olivers to purchase the morning\nGazette Times\nand its evening sister, the\nChronicle Telegraph\n, while\nPaul Block\narranged to buy out the owner of the morning\nPost\nand evening\nSun\n. After swapping the\nSun\nin return for Hearst's\nGazette Times\n, Block had both morning papers, which he combined to form the\nPost-Gazette\n. Hearst united the evening papers, creating the\nSun-Telegraph\n. Both new papers debuted on August 2, 1927.\n[\n18\n]\nJoint operating agreement\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1960, Pittsburgh had three daily papers: the\nPost-Gazette\nin the morning, and the\nPittsburgh Press\nand the\nPittsburgh Sun-Telegraph\nin the evening and on Sunday. The\nPost-Gazette\nbought the\nSun-Telegraph\nand moved into the\nSun-Telegraph'\ns Grant Street offices.\n[\n19\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\ntried to publish a Sunday paper to compete with the\nSunday Press\nbut it was not profitable; rising costs in general were challenging the company's bottom line.\n[\n20\n]\nIn November 1961, the\nPost-Gazette\nentered into an agreement with the Pittsburgh Press Company to combine their production and advertising sales operations.\n[\n21\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nowned and operated its own news and editorial departments, but production and distribution of the paper was handled by the larger Press office.\n[\n21\n]\nThis agreement stayed in place for over 30 years.\n[\n22\n]\nThe agreement gave the\nPost-Gazette\na new home in the\nPress\nbuilding, a comfortable upgrade from the hated \"Sun-Telly barn\".\n[\n23\n]\nConstructed for the\nPress\nin 1927 and expanded with a curtain wall in 1962, the building served as the\nPost-Gazette\nheadquarters until 2015.\n[\n24\n]\nStrike, consolidation, new competition\n[\nedit\n]\nThe distribution center of the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\nin the\nFindlay Township\nOn May 17, 1992, a\nstrike\nby workers for the\nPress\nshut down publication of the\nPress\n; the joint operating agreement meant that the\nPost-Gazette\nalso ceased to publish.\n[\n25\n]\nDuring the strike, the\nScripps Howard\ncompany sold the\nPress\nto the Block family, owners of the\nPost-Gazette\n.\n[\n22\n]\nThe Blocks did not resume printing the\nPress\n, and when the labor issue was resolved and publishing resumed, the\nPost-Gazette\nbecame the city's major paper, under the full masthead name\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette Sun-Telegraph/The Pittsburgh Press\n. The Block ownership did not take this opportunity to address labor costs, which had led to sale of the\nPress\n. This would come back to haunt them and lead to financial problems (see \"Financial Challenges\" below).\nDuring the strike, publisher\nRichard Mellon Scaife\nexpanded his paper, the\nGreensburg\nTribune-Review\n, based in the\ncounty seat\nof adjoining\nWestmoreland County\n, where it had published for years. While maintaining the original paper in its facilities in Greensburg, he expanded it with a new Pittsburgh edition to serve the city and its suburbs. Scaife named this paper the\nPittsburgh Tribune-Review\n.\n[\n26\n]\nScaife has invested significant amounts of capital into upgraded facilities, separate offices and newsroom on Pittsburgh's North Side and a state of the art production facility in\nMarshall Township\nnorth of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. Relations between the\nPost-Gazette\nand\nTribune-Review,\nduring its existence as a local print publication, were often competitive and frequently hostile, given Scaife's longstanding distaste for what he considered the Blocks' liberalism.\nOn 14 November 2011 the\nPost-Gazette\nrevived the\nPittsburgh Press\nas an afternoon\nonline newspaper\n.\n[\n27\n]\nOn 12 February 2014, the paper purchased a new distribution facility in suburban\nFindlay Township, Pennsylvania\n.\n[\n28\n]\nIn 2015 the paper moved into a new, state-of-the-art office building on the\nNorth Shore\non a portion of the former site of\nThree Rivers Stadium\n, ending 53 years in the former\nPress\nbuilding and more than two centuries in Downtown.\n[\n29\n]\nBlock Communications sold the Downtown Post-Gazette building in 2019 to DiCicco Development, Inc., a developer headquartered in\nMoon Township\n, for $13.25 million.\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\nAs of late 2022, DiCicco Development is still deciding what type of use might work best on the property.\nOn 6 October 2022 the advertising, distribution and production workers at the Post Gazette went on strike. On October 18, the newsroom workers joined the strike.\n[\n32\n]\nThe\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB)\nalso pursued a case against the paper charging unfair practices. As of March 2023 the strike had not been settled and the NLRB case was pending before an administrative law judge.\n[\n33\n]\nAs of January 2024, the unions were still on strike against the Post-Gazette.\n[\n34\n]\n[\n35\n]\nIn April 2024 the National Labor Relations Board announced it was authorizing a request from the newspaper's unions to seek a temporary injunction against the Post-Gazette's ownership for violating workers' labor rights.\n[\n36\n]\nThe Post-Gazette's striking workers have published an online\nstrike paper\n,\nPittsburgh Union Progress\n.\n[\n37\n]\nPartnerships and sponsorships\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nbuilding in October 2015.\nThe newspaper sponsored a 23,000 seat\noutdoor amphitheater\nin\nBurgettstown, Pennsylvania\n, the \"Post-Gazette Pavilion\", although it is still often referred to as \"Star Lake\", based on the original name, \"Star Lake Amphitheater\", and later \"\nCoca-Cola\nStar Lake Amphitheater\" under the former sponsor. They gave up\nnaming rights\nin 2010.\n[\n38\n]\nFirst Niagara Bank\n, which had entered the Pittsburgh market the year before after\nacquiring\nNational City\nbranches from Pittsburgh-based\nPNC Financial Services\n,\n[\n39\n]\ntook over the naming rights to the facility and is now known as the\nKeyBank Pavilion\n.\n[\n38\n]\nThe newspaper once had ventures in television. In 1957, the Post-Gazette partnered with the H. Kenneth Brennen family, local radio owners, to launch WIIC-TV (now\nWPXI\n) as the area's first full-time\nNBC\naffiliate.\n[\n40\n]\n[\n41\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nand the Brennens sold off the station to current owner\nCox Enterprises\nin 1964.\n[\n42\n]\nAlthough the\nPost-Gazette\nand WPXI have on occasion had some news partnerships, the Post-Gazette's primary news partner is now the local\nCBS\nowned-and-operated\nstation\nKDKA-TV\n.\nIn 2019, the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\nwas a founding member of\nSpotlight PA\n, an\ninvestigative reporting\npartnership focused on Pennsylvania.\n[\n43\n]\nFinancial challenges\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen John Craig handed editorial reign to\nDavid Shribman\nin 2003, Craig told Shribman that the paper was in terrible financial shape. It was around the time of\nHanukkah\n, and Shribman quipped, \"It seemed there was only enough oil in this newspaper to keep the light on for one year.\"\n[\n44\n]\nIn September 2006 the paper disclosed that it was experiencing financial challenges, largely related to its labor costs. The paper also disclosed it had not been profitable since printing had resumed in 1993. As a result of these issues, the paper considered a number of options, including putting the paper up for sale.\n[\n45\n]\nIn August 2018 the\nPost-Gazette\nceased publishing daily.\n[\n46\n]\nIt cut down to online editions on Tuesdays and Saturdays and print editions the remaining days of the week. In October 2019, the paper further reduced its paper editions to Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays.\n[\n47\n]\nIn March 2021, the paper cut down again, getting rid of the Friday edition.\n[\n48\n]\nControversies\n[\nedit\n]\nFiring of cartoonist\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2018, the\nPost Gazette\nfired its long-time editorial cartoonist,\nRob Rogers\n, a previous\nPulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning\nfinalist who had worked at the paper for 25 years,\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\nhaving joined the paper in 1993\n[\n52\n]\nand worked under four\nsupervising editors\n.\n[\n51\n]\nThe firing came in the context of increasing support for President\nDonald Trump\nand political conservatism on the\nPost-Gazette\neditorial page.\n[\n49\n]\nPittsburgh mayor\nWilliam Peduto\n(who was both a friend of Rogers' and had been lampooned in his cartoons) called the paper's firing of Rogers \"disappointing\" and said it sent \"the wrong message about press freedoms.\"\n[\n53\n]\n[\n51\n]\nThe firing was strongly criticized by the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh\n[\n49\n]\nand the\nNational Cartoonists Society\n.\n[\n51\n]\nThe Association of American Editorial Cartoonists said in a statement: \"It's as simple as this: Rogers was fired for refusing to do cartoons extolling Trump. Let that sink in.\"\n[\n50\n]\nThe paper said that Rogers' dismissal \"has little to do with politics, ideology or Donald Trump\" but did not provide details.\n[\n51\n]\nRogers wrote in the\nNew York Times\nthat the paper's new management had decided, in the lead-up to his firing, that his cartoons satirizing Trump \"were 'too angry.\n'\n\"\n[\n52\n]\nRogers said that while editors had previously rejected (or \"\nspiked\n\") an average of two to three of his cartoons each year, under a new supervisor he had 19 cartoons or cartoon ideas killed in the first six months of 2018.\n[\n51\n]\nFour months after Rogers was fired, the\nPost-Gazette\nhired conservative editorial cartoonist\nSteve Kelley\nas Rogers' replacement.\n[\n54\n]\nAfter being fired, Rogers' comics continued to be published through\nAndrews McMeel Syndication\n.\n[\n51\n]\nAs a freelancer, Rogers was named as a finalist for the\n2019 Pulitzer Prize\nin editorial cartooning, with the committee citing his \"provocative illustrations that channeled cultural and historical references with expert artistry and an eye for hypocrisy and injustice.\"\n[\n55\n]\nSanctioning of reporter amid George Floyd protests\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2020, the\nPost-Gazette\nprohibited its reporter Alexis Johnson from covering the\nGeorge Floyd protests\n.\n[\n56\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nsaid that Johnson, an\nAfrican American\n, had shown bias by making a tweet that highlighted extensive littering from a\nKenny Chesney\nconcert tailgate. The pulling of Johnson from the story prompted an outcry from journalists, including the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh and many of Johnson's\nPost-Gazette\ncolleagues.\n[\n56\n]\nAwards\n[\nedit\n]\nPulitzer Prizes\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nwon\nPulitzer Prizes\nin\n1938\n,\n1998\n, and\n2019\n. Photographer Morris Berman maintained that the paper would have also won a Pulitzer in\n1964\n, had it chosen to run the iconic photo of\nY. A. Tittle\nthat he took at\nPitt Stadium\n,\n[\n57\n]\nwhich would go on to win awards, hang in the\nPro Football Hall of Fame\n, and be used for the back cover of Tittle's autobiography and in a\nMiller Beer\nHigh-Life commercial in 2005.\nIn 1938,\nRay Sprigle\nwon the\nPulitzer Prize for Reporting\nfor his investigation revealing that newly appointed Supreme Court Justice\nHugo Black\nhad been a member of the\nKu Klux Klan\n.\nStaff photographer\nMartha Rial\nwon the 1998\nPulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography\nfor her photographs of\nRwandan\nand\nBurundian\nrefugees.\nPhotographer\nJohn Kaplan\nwon the\n1992\nPulitzer Prize for Feature Photography\nfor a series of photo essays on 21-year-olds, which was published in the\nPost-Gazette\nand two other papers of the Block Newspapers group.\n[\n58\n]\nThis award cited Block Newspapers rather than the\nPost-Gazette\nspecifically.\n[\n59\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nwon the 2019\nPulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting\nfor its coverage of the\nPittsburgh synagogue shooting\n. The paper was praised for its \"immersive, compassionate coverage.\"\n[\n60\n]\nOther awards\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 1997, Bill Moushey won the\nNational Press Club\n’s Freedom of Information Award on a series investigating the Federal Witness Protection Program and was a finalist for the Pulitzer.\n[\n61\n]\n[\n62\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nalso won the\nWilbur Award\nfrom the\nReligion Communicators Council\n(RCC) in 2017 for religion editor Peter Smith's work,\nSilent Sanctuaries\n.\n[\n63\n]\nSmith, Stephanie Strasburg, and Shelly Bradbury were finalists for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for an investigation into sexual abuse in Pennsylvania's Amish and Mennonite communities.\n[\n64\n]\nMichael Sallah\n, Michael Korsh and Evan Robinson-Johnson of the\nPost-Gazette\n, with\nProPublica\n, won the 2023\nGeorge Polk Award\nfor medical reporting for a series on Philips Respironics' efforts to continue marketing their breathing machines despite knowing they were dangerous to users.\n[\n65\n]\nEndorsement\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nPost-Gazette\nhistorically sided with\nmodern liberalism\nin its editorial stance. However, it turned more\nconservative\nin the 2010s, especially following the 2018 consolidation of its editorial department with that of longtime sister newspaper\nThe Blade\nof\nToledo, Ohio\n, and  the appointment of\nThe Blade's\neditorial page editor, Keith Burris, a frequent defender of\nDonald Trump\n, as the\nPost-Gazette's\neditorial page editor.\n[\n2\n]\nBurris assumed the additional position of executive editor of the\nPost-Gazette\nin 2019.\n[\n66\n]\nIn 2020, the\nPost-Gazette\nendorsed Trump's reelection bid, the first time since the\n1972 US presidential election\nthat the paper had endorsed a Republican for president.\n[\n67\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nJournalism portal\nChronicle-Telegraph\nCup\nTom Barnes\nAl Helfer\nCy Hungerford\nJames O'Toole\nPittsburgh Tribune-Review\nMartha Rial\n, 1998 Pulitzer Prize winner\nDennis Roddy\nBob Smizik\nBill Steigerwald\nY.
