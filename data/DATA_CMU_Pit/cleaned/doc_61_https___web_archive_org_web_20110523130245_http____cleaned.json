In its 2007 college football annual, The Sporting Newsnamed Cavanaugh the top offensive coordinator in the Big East and for good reason. In Cavanaugh, Pitt has a well-versed offensive mind who has experience on both the pro and college levels. Overseeing a unit rife with youth last year, the Panthers produced their first 1,000-yard rusher in seven years. Tailback LeSean McCoy rushed for a BigEast freshman record 1,328 yards and topped all freshman runners nationally with 110.67 yards per game. McCoy set Pitt freshman records for points(90) and rushing touchdowns (14), surpassingthe legendary Tony Dorsett s 34-year-old marks (78 points, 13 rushing TDs in 1973). In 2006, Pitt ranked among the nation s top 20 in three different major offensive categories, including pass efficiency (third, 166.79 rating), scoring (14th, 31.75 points per game) and passing (20th, 249.25 yards per game). Pitt s scoring average of nearly 32 points per game that season was its highest in 25 years. Only the Panthers 1981 edition, which averaged 32.1 points under quarterback Dan Marino, scored at a higher clip during that span. Individually, quarterback Tyler Palko, now with the New Orleans Saints, was a major beneficiary of Cavanaugh s guidance. As a senior, Palko led the Big East and ranked fourth in the country in pass efficiency (163.25). He finished his career ranked second all-time at Pitt in total offense (8,429) and touchdown passes (tied with 66) and additionally finished third in career passing yards (8,343). Cavanaugh has renewed ties with Dave Wannstedt for the third time. Wannstedt was an assistant on the Pitt staff during the final three years of Cavanaugh s sparkling collegiate career from 1974-77. The pair also worked together in the NFL when Wannstedt was the head coach of the Chicago Bears and Cavanaugh his offensive coordinator. Cavanaugh will forever be remembered in Panther lore for quarterbacking Pitt to the 1976 national championship. He capped that magical season with an MVP performance in the Sugar Bowl, leading Pittsburgh to a 27-3 demolition of Georgia. Cavanaugh scored the first touchdown of the game and the celebration of that score became a Sports Illustratedcover (Jan. 10, 1977), which is still displayed at several locales on campus. His effective blend of passing and running made him an All-American in 1977 and his 3,378 career passing yards still rank 13th in Pitt annals. He returned to Pittsburgh in 2005 with an impressive resume as a player and coach on both the collegiate and professional levels. In addition to his collegiate championship, Cavanaugh earned three Super Bowl rings, including two as a player (with the San Francisco 49ers in 1984 and the New York Giants in 1990) and one as a coach (Baltimore Ravens in 2000). A native of Youngstown, Ohio, and graduate of Chaney High, Cavanaugh spent 14 years as a quarterback in the National Football League. A second-round selection of New England in 1978, he spent five seasons (1978-82) with the Patriots before moving on to stints with the San Francisco 49ers (1983-85), Philadelphia Eagles (1986-89) and New York Giants (1990-91). Cavanaugh began his coaching career at Pitt, where he served as tight ends coach for John Majors in 1993. He then moved back to the NFL, serving as quarterbacks coach for the Arizona Cardinals from 1994-95 and at San Francisco in 1996. From 1997-98, Cavanaugh was offensive coordinator for Chicago, serving under Wannstedt, who was the Bears head coach. He then was the offensive coordinator at Baltimore (1999-2004), where during the Ravens Super Bowl season he orchestrated a rushing attack that produced a franchise-record 2,199 yards. Cavanaugh earned his bachelor s degree from Pitt in administration of justice.

NORDENBERG the annual assessment of The Top American Research Universities. That study, prepared by the Center for Measuring University Performance, is tied to objective measures spanning key areas of performance faculty awards, quality undergraduates, strength of graduate and post-graduate programs, research impact and private support. Only seven universities were included in the Center s very top cluster Berkeley, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Pitt, UCLA and Wisconsin. The University also advanced on two key measures of research strength. In terms of National Institutes of Health grants attracted by members of our faculty, we moved into sixth place nationally. The NIH top 10 consists of Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Penn, the University of California at San Francisco, the University of Washington, Pitt, UCLA, Duke, Michigan and Washington University in St. Louis. In terms of total federal science and engineering research and development grants won by our faculty, Pitt now ranks 11th nationally sitting just outside a very strong top 10 that consists of Johns Hopkins, Washington, Penn, UCLA, Michigan, Stanford, the University of California at San Francisco, Duke, Columbia and Harvard. In terms of student achievement, Pitt undergraduates continued to win national honors, adding to a list of awards that, just since 1995, includes two Rhodes Scholarships, six Marshall Scholarships, five Truman Scholarships, four Udall Scholarships, one Churchill Scholarship, 31 Goldwater Scholarships, and three Mellon Humanities Fellows. Of course, tens of thousands of other Pitt students crafted more private, but equally important, records of achievement, as they continued to build the educational foundations from which they will When Mark Nordenberg and his family then consisting This past summer marked the end of Professor pursue their own life dreams.

It was, in short, another period of Arts and Sciences.

Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Dean of the School of Law, Interim Provost and Chancellor In terms of overall performance, this was the second Engineering, two Howard Hughes Medical Foundation of the University. consecutive year in which Pitt was ranked in the very Early Career Physician Scientist Awards, five National top cluster of America s public research universities in Science Foundation Early Career Development Awards, and a Beckman Young Investigator s Award. 192The University celebrated a truly transformational event when University Trustee John Swanson made his historic 41.3 million gift to support what now has been named the Swanson School of Engineering in his honor. As Chancellor Nordenberg noted at the time, it is highly unusual for one of a university s most distinguished graduates the winner of the Fritz Medal, engineering s highest honor, and the founder of ANSYS, a major Pittsburgh area employer and a global pioneer in the application of software to product design and testing to also become its most generous donor. Dr. Swanson s gift helped propel Pitt past the 1.25 billion mark in its 2 billion capital campaign. Attracting such support is critical at a time when government support for public higher education is lagging. The Commonwealth appropriation, which once represented nearly one-third of Pitt s annual operating budget, now amounts to just 11 percent of that budget, for example. In athletics, the past year brought many memorable performances. Among them, our football Panthers derailed the national-championship-bound Mountaineer Express. Our men s basketball team captured the Big East Tournament Championship. Our women s basketball team reached the NCAA s Sweet Sixteen for the first time ever. And wrestler Keith Gavin completed a remarkable, 27-win, undefeated season by claiming an NCAA championship.

Pederson was at the forefront of the football program s move into the UPMC Sports Performance Complex, which included the forging of a unique relationship between UPMC, a professional sports franchise and college athletic program.
