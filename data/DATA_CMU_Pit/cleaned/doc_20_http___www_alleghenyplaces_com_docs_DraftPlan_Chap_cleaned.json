In 1980, over 25 of all County earnings were generated from durable goods manufacturing industries, specifically steel and related sectors. By 2000, durable The County s businesses and institutions form the core of goods manufacturing had declined to less than 9 of southwestern Pennsylvania s economy and have driven County earnings. Over the same time frame, the services economic growth trends throughout the region. For nearly sector share of County earnings increased from 21 to 150 years, the region had the luxury of a sizable core of 35. The contribution of other major sectors stayed relatively well-paying manufacturing jobs. The concentration of heavy the same. industries was such that it displaced the development of other industries. That lack of diversification did not serve the region well, as the industries long relied upon for economic stability declined rapidly. Small businesses represent 99 of the County s economic enterprises and employ more than 265,000 people. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor, there were nearly 35,000 business establishments in Allegheny County in 2004, more than any other county in the state. Allegheny County s business establishments comprise nearly 11 of the state s total. EMPLOYMENT GROWTH In 2003, employment within Allegheny County reached almost 881,000, the highest employment in the County s Photo credit McCormick Taylor history.

Recent job losses have occurred in sectors that depend on Within a short period of time in the early 1980s, the long- population growth government, retail, construction, and term slow decline in the region s manufacturing industries transportation and warehousing. became a massive freefall.

Total employment today exceeds levels comparable Over the past two decades, the County s economy has to the period before the decline of manufacturing shifted away from heavy manufacturing to other industries. employment in the 1980s. This transformation has resulted in a much more diversified economic base for the County that more closely matches national trends. Manufacturing remains an important GENDER AND THE WORKFORCE sector of the County s economy, but it is no longer the only significant generator of income. Historically, women in the region have had unusually low rates of participation in the workforce. But as the regional The restructuring of Allegheny County s economy is seen economy shifted away from heavy manufacturing industries, by examining industry shares of earnings and changes new job opportunities opened for women. The primary reason that employment and workforce participation levels www.alleghenyplaces.com 4C - 1have been increasing in the County over the last 30 years Figure 4C.2 shows that women in Allegheny County are despite continuing population declines is because more concentrated in the lower income brackets while men women have entered the workforce. This has been one of the outnumbered women in all of the higher income levels. most significant transformations in the regional and County workforce in recent decades. HOUSEHOLD INCOME The restructuring of the Pittsburgh regional economy has also had a profound effect on household income levels (see Figure 4C.3). In 1970 and 1980, Allegheny County had a higher median household income than both the U.S. and Pennsylvania. In 1990 and 2000, median household income in the County fell below the median for both nation and state.

On the other hand, Allegheny County maintains a concentration It has only been recently that the County s rate of female of relatively well-paying jobs and a moderately low poverty workforce participation has matched national levels. rate (11 ), which contributes to it having a higher per capita income than the region, state or nation. Between 1971 and 2000, the number of men in the Allegheny County workforce decreased by nearly 18, while the number of women in the workforce increased by The lowest household incomes in the County are almost 14 (see Figure 4C.1). By 2000, women had become generally found in the older industrial communities. 48 of Allegheny County s total workforce, a rate is slightly higher than the national average of 46.

Women were concentrated in lower income earning levels in 2000. One disparity that has not lessened over time is the workforce participation of African American men.

African American men age 16 and over had a workforce participation rate of 59 in 2000, compared to 70 for White males. Low workforce participation rates for African American men are one component leading to the low household income level for African Americans (see Figure 4C.5). 1 4, 9 9 9 5 o, r 0 l 0 es 0 s 1 0, 9, 0 9 0 9 0 9 1 1 5, 4, 0 9 0 9 0 9 2 0 1, 9 0, 0 9 0 9 9 2 5 2, 4 0, 0 9 0 9 9 3 3 5, 4, 0 9 0 9 0 9 4 5 4, 4 0, 0 9 0 9 9 5 5 5, 4 0, 0 9 0 9 9 6 5 6, 4 0, 0 9 0 9 9 7 7 5, 4, 0 9 0 9 0 9 9 9, 9 9 9 1 0 0, 0 0 0 j h A M u o m s e u t d e s 5 i r e a 4 i h c n o a l h n d o o s f i u w n t s h c a e e o h s m c o j o u l e d m s t o i p n o f a c v n o r e e a m r a b r e l l e 2 y f 2 o m r, 4 0 e A 1 d 0 f i, 0 r a 0 i, n c 0 o a 0 r n for the White alone population. (Nationally, the median household income for African American men Source Pittsburgh REMI Model as published in Allegheny County Economic Trends is 66 of that of Whites.) African American poverty rates greatly impact their diet, health care, housing and child care options. While the Pittsburgh region experienced a slight increase in the unemployment rate since 2000, the increase was greater for African American females compared to any other group. Among those adults able to work, the rise in unemployment for African American females was nearly 5 (versus 3 for African American males), whereas for White males and females unemploy- ment rose less than 1 between 2001 and 2005, according to the University of Pittsburgh s Center for Social and Urban Research. A June 2007 report of the University of Pittsburgh s Center on Race and Social Problems revealed that the quality of life of African Americans in the region is more difficult and disadvantaged when compared to national averages. The report, Pittsburgh s Racial Demographics Differences and Disparities, provides indicators of quality of life by race and ethnicity in the region.

ECONOMIC SECTORS As the region s employment center, Allegheny County attracts significant numbers of workers from not only Pennsylvania, but also Ohio and West Virginia (see Figure 4C.6).

As is true in many areas of the country, computer specialists are the fastest growing occupation in the County, growing by nearly 17,000 jobs between 1971 and 2000. The relative increase of almost 730 in computer specialists between those years was second only to personal and home care Photo credit McCormick Taylor aides, which increased by over 910 during that period. Other fast growing occupations in the County include health care support, health diagnostics, lawyers and other health professionals and technicians. Between 1999 and 2004, the rate of growth for science and engineering jobs in the Pittsburgh region1exceeded most other major metropolitan regions in the country. The 6,000 new jobs in this sector pay an average of 50 more than the overall average wage for the region. In 2004, the average annual wage for those employed in education, training, and library occupations in the region exceeded the U.S. average by 12.

In Core Places it is generally expected that much new development will be through infill development and the rehabilitation and reuse of existing buildings, including the adaptive reuse of former industrial or warehouse sites and structures. Corridor Corridor Places have access to major highways and interchanges, and are relatively intense, mixed-use hubs of development. A range of office, industrial, commercial, and residential uses are provided for, as well as uses that require larger amounts of land, such as regional shopping centers and business parks. Topographic and other natural features will favor certain types of uses over others at some locations, but there are a sufficient number of designated Corridor Places to ensure there is choice in the marketplace.
