There are two complete vaulting set-ups, one of which lands into a resipit and one into foam block. Three sets of uneven bars are being used, including one over a resipit. There is also a single bar over a foam block resipit and a trench bar system. Pitt s facility houses fi ve balance beams, complete with mount and dismount areas, plus a low beam, stacked beams and beam dismounts into pits. A full fl oor exercise includes tumbling pits off the end and a rod fl oor tumble trac into a resipit. Next to the resipit is an in-ground trampoline and added features to the facility include space for lockers, bench seating, cardio equipment and music center as well as mirrors and record boards. The Gymnastics Training Center allows for the equipment to remain in place at all times. It includes new resi and foam pits, allowing for safer training. The gymnasts are able to attempt higher-level skills because they are in a safer environment. In addition to the diffi culty level the gymnasts have been able to train at, the facility has allowed the coaches to recruit higher-level gymnasts. The setup and equipment have been appealing to many top-notch gymnasts because they know they will be able to maintain their current level of diffi culty as well as improve. We are so fortunate to have one of the fi nest training facilities around, said Head Coach Debbie Yohman. We have everything we need to train all levels of gymnastics from elite student-athletes to young campers. Everyone who sets foot in our training center is impressed. The University of Pittsburgh has made a big commitment to Panther Gymnastics. Pitt s facility has three sets of uneven bars, including one over a resipit, plus a single bar over a foam block resipit. The Gymnastics Training Center houses seven balance beams, with full mount and dismount pits, and a low training beam. The fl oor exercise area includes tumbling pits off the end and a rod fl oor into a foam block pit. Next to the pit is an in-ground trampoline. 4 2007 PITT GYMNASTICS 4TEAM ROSTER 2007 ALPHABETICAL ROSTER PANTHERS BY STATE Name Year Event Hometown High School Maryland..........................................3 New Hampshire...............................1 Andrea Arlotta SR AA Cincinnati, Ohio Northwest New Jersey......................................1 Brittany Baldwin JR V, UB, BB Downingtown, Pa.
