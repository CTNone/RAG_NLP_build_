Freshman MICHELLE ROSSI of Cleveland, Ohio, will take over the role after averaging 3.5 kills and 4.7 digs per game as a high school senior. An all-district honoree and three-time All-North Coast League selection, Rossi additionally played for the Ohio High Performance Team, which placed third nationally in 2003. It s funny because we had McGrane who s such a legend and started the position as libero, so I d say the next person com- ing in has a lot of pressure, said Beerman. The one person that I felt would be able to handle it is Michelle, and that s high praise I know. But Michelle is a very tough competitor, and she s also been a long-time libero. We looked at almost every libero in the country coming out of high school, and I thought she was the best. Junior MELISSA FERGUSON returns as a defensive spe- cialist for the upcoming season. She saw action in 22 matches last year and set a career-high two service aces against West Virginia. She also played a critical role in the Panthers win over Notre Dame. Melissa s great at staying focused on the sideline, Beerman said. And when you need her, she delivers. I think that is the one In her first season with the Panthers, Nicole Taurence led the thing I can say about Melissa. She is a clutch player.

Arizona had a lot of success in 2005, earning a spot as a top 10 team, and Eastern Illinois continues to have a growing program.

Beerman, while current players Diana Andreyko and Nicole Taurence A runner-up in 2004 and the 2003 champions in the Big East Tourna- have already etched their names all over the Pitt record books. ment, the Panthers have earned two NCAA berths since Beerman has been at the helm. Their advance into the 2004 NCAAs came from an at- large bid the ultimate sign of respect for a volleyball team. Pitt finished 17-13 in 2005 and tied for fourth in the Big East. The team had three All-Big East selections and senior Megan McGrane earned her second Big East Libero of the Year award and an AVCA All-America honorable mention. His team continued to re-write both the Pitt and NCAA record books as McGrane became the school s all-time leader in digs nearly 1,000 ahead of everyone else, and she ranked fourth among Division I players. Diana Andreyko tied the then Big-East record for kills and is leading the books with a record of eight service aces in a game. Nicole Taurence broke the Pitt freshman record with 69 assists in the five-set win over Rutgers. Pitt won 26 games in 2004 and enjoyed its best winning percentage (.813) since finishing 32-6 in 1990, which was also the only other time the Panthers advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Panthers won the 2003 Big East championship with a 3-0 victory over defending champion Notre Dame at the Joyce Center in South Bend. It was the first time a Big East team had defeated the Fighting Irish on their home court ever. Beerman s team then advanced to its first NCAA Tournament since 1994 and defeated the Penn Quakers, 3-1, before falling to host Penn State in four games in the second round. For his efforts, Beerman was named the Big East Co-Coach of the Year and the Tachikara AVCA Northeast Region Coach of the Year by his peers. I consider this team an NCAA team now, Beerman said. Once you get that first at-large berth, you have to think that way. You have to schedule your matches that way, and we have to play that way. The revival of the program, though, began a year earlier. After injuries depleted the 2001 Panthers, the program suffered through its first losing 88888 22222000000000066666 PPPPPIIIIITTTTTTTTTT VVVVVOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEYYYYYBBBBBAAAAALLLLLLLLLL 12475PittVballText.pmd 8 9 8 2006, 12 01 PMIn 2004, Miller was named the Big East s Most Valuable Player while Diana Andreyko was the conference and region Rookie of the Year. In 2003, Hatlestad was the Big East MVP, Miller earned Most Outstanding Player honors in the Big East Championships, and McGrane was named the inaugural Libero of the Year and claimed the award again in 2005. Beerman, who is just the sixth coach in Pitt volleyball history, boasts a successful track record as both a player and coach. His background, coupled with an unbridled enthusiasm and energy, made him the perfect choice to lead the Panthers back into the national spotlight. I approached this from the very beginning as a building process, Beerman said. We had to rebuild as a volleyball program when I got here in 2000 and we ve been able to get positive results from that process. It s a totally different situation than it was here five years ago. We re entering into a reloading year. Even though we lost significant contributors to our run the past two years, we have the talent to continue making the NCAA Tournament and advancing further. Beerman joined Pittsburgh after serving four seasons (1996-99) as head coach at James Madison University, where he led the Dukes to their first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance and four straight winning sea- sons. He guided the Dukes to a 90-36 overall record and a 35-7 mark in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), which included an impressive 22-0 home record against conference foes. He led his teams to three 20-win seasons at JMU, including 1999 s best-ever record of 26-7, which fea- tured a berth in the NCAA Tournament. In his first year at the helm of the Dukes in 1996, Beerman orchestrated the biggest turnaround of any NCAA team that season when he guided his squad to a 25-9 record after finishing 9-18 in the prior year. At JMU, Beerman garnered two conference coach of the year awards (1998 and 1999), produced one CAA Player of the Year (1999) in Lindsay Collingwood, a pair of CAA Rookie of the Year honorees, nine first-team and five second-team selections, as well as five first-team all-state awards. Additionally, his teams captured two regular season CAA championships The Beerman Family (From left to right) Jackson, (1998 and 1999) and the 1999 tournament championship. wife Mary-Beth, Kendall and Chris.
