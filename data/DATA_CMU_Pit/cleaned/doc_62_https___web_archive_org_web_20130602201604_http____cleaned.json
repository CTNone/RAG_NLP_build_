An aggressive, experienced and hard-working rebounder and a shot blocker, Taylor led the Panthers with 25 blocks and averaged 5.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game last season. He also shot a team-best 57.7 percent (86-149) from the floor. Taylor, who ranks among Pitt s best shot blockers of all-time (67 career blocks) should see plenty of opportunities to contribute as a leader and key post player during his senior season in 2012-13. Pitt s most highly ranked recruit in school history, seven-foot, 250-pound Steven Adams, has the potential to aid the Panthers on both ends of the floor. A New Zealand native, Adams has immense physical tools including superb athleticism, long arms, a wide wingspan and great hands. Offensively, he is comfortable in the post and has the ability to showcase a variety of shots from an effective jump hook to a face up mid-range jumper. On defense, opponents will be aware of his physicality and ability to block and alter shots.

NORDENBERG Under Chancellor Mark Nordenberg s leadership, the University has achieved new levels of quality and impact on virtually every front. Born and raised in northern Minnesota, Mark Nordenberg first came to Pittsburgh as a high school senior, when his father, who worked for U.S. Steel, was transferred here. Though that move was not welcomed by anyone in the family at the time, all of the Nordenbergs quickly fell in love with this region and its people. In less than two years, the Chancellor s father had been transferred again, this time to Chicago, and everyone in the family drifted back to what he calls the true midwest. But when the Chancellor had the chance to return to Pittsburgh as a young adult and join Pitt s law faculty, he quickly seized that opportunity. Pitt and Pittsburgh now have been his home for more than thirty-five years. Chancellor Nordenberg joined the faculty of Pitt s School of Law in 1977 and quickly built a reputation as an outstanding teacher. He was the initial recipient of the Excellence in Teaching Award now presented annually by the Law School s graduating class. He also was one of the first faculty members to receive the Chancellor s Distinguished Teaching Award, recognizing teaching excellence university-wide. His area of academic specialty is civil litigation, and he has served as a member of both the U.S. Supreme Court s Advisory Committee on Civil Rules and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court s Civil Procedural Rules Committee.
