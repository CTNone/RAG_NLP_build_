The hilly course runs through the city center and crosses each of Pittsburgh's three main rivers.  Generally, over 3,000 runners finish the marathon each year.  The weekend's events also include a\nhalf marathon\n,\nmarathon relay\n, and\n5K\n.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe marathon was first announced on October 3, 1984, with\nU.S. Steel\nand\nPNC Bank\nas sponsors.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nThe inaugural marathon was held on\nMay 5, 1985\n.\n[\n4\n]\nThe Pittsburgh Marathon hosted the United States Olympic Marathon Trials for women in 1988 and for men in 2000.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThe trials used the same course that the main marathon did, but were considered separate events from the main marathon.\n[\n4\n]\nIn addition, Pittsburgh has served as the site for the United States men's national championship three times, the National Wheelchair Championship in 1986, as well as the Olympic Marathon Trials for both Finland and Denmark in the 1980s.\nIn 1996, the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\n(UPMC) became the title sponsor, replacing\nGiant Eagle\n, and the race was renamed the UPMC/City of Pittsburgh Marathon (or a variation thereof) for a few years.\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nIn late 2003, serious financial difficulty within the City of Pittsburgh municipal budget and UPMC's withdraw from the title sponsorship led to the suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008.\n[\n7\n]\nIn 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor,\nDick's Sporting Goods\n.\n[\n9\n]\nIn 2010, a small\nmicrowave oven\ncontaining a suspected explosive device was found on the sidewalk near the finish line.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nBecause\na car bombing attempt\nin\nNew York City\nhad emptied\nTimes Square\nthe previous day, authorities were on high alert and delayed the race for about 10 minutes while a\nbomb squad\nrobot neutralized the oven's contents by blowing up the microwave.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n12\n]\nRavioli\nwas found among its contents, and police later believed the oven had never contained any explosives.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n13\n]\nThe 2020 and 2021 editions of the race were cancelled due to the\ncoronavirus pandemic\n, with all registrants having the option to either run the race virtually or obtain a refund.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nCourse\n[\nedit\n]\nHistorically, the course has wound through the unique and hilly topography of the city. Crossing five different bridges, the course traverses all three rivers of Pittsburgh at least once. The start and finish lines have changed many times, but have always been in either\nDowntown\nor the\nNorth Shore\n. Previous finish lines have included\nPoint State Park\n,\nDavid L. Lawrence Convention Center\n, and the 50-yard line of\nHeinz Field\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe current finish line is on the\nBoulevard of the Allies\nnear Point State Park.  Numerous other historic and well-known\nPittsburgh neighborhoods\nare along the route, including the\nSouth Side\n,\nOakland\n,\nShadyside\n,\nEast Liberty\n,\nHighland Park\n,\nBloomfield\n,\nLawrenceville\n, and the\nStrip District\n.\nOther races\n[\nedit\n]\nAside from the main\nmarathon\nevent, several races occur during the weekend of the marathon, including a\nhalf marathon\n, two to five person\nmarathon relay\n,\n5K race\n, and \"kids marathon\".  All races except for the \"kids marathon\" and 5K utilize the same starting time and largely the same course  as the marathon.\nParticipation\n[\nedit\n]\nAttendance and popularity of the events has risen greatly since the 2009 revival. The 2012 race had the largest field in the history of the race.  Registration for 2012 closed with roughly 25,000 participants between all races, with 6,000 entrants in the full marathon, 13,000 entrants in the half marathon, and 800 teams in the marathon relay, with the remaining entrants registered for the 5K.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\nAdditionally, an estimated 60,000 spectators lined the course, and 4,000 volunteers provided assistance.\n[\n20\n]\n2012 also marked the earliest sellout in the race's history with all events except the 5K selling out on or before March 6, 2012.\n[\n19\n]\nThroughout the course, thousands of neighborhood residents show their support by lining the streets of the course and volunteering at aid stations.\n[\n21\n]\nNeighborhood organizations are awarded financial grants for community-engaging celebrations along the route.\n[\n21\n]\nSixty bands, almost all of which are from the\nGreater Pittsburgh\narea, line the streets throughout the course, spanning a range of musical genres.\n[\n22\n]\nWinners\n[\nedit\n]\nKey\n:\nCourse record (in bold)\nAmerican championship race\nEd.\nDate\nMen's winner\nTime\n[\nc\n]\nWomen's winner\nTime\n[\nc\n]\nRf.\n1\n1985.05.05\nKen
