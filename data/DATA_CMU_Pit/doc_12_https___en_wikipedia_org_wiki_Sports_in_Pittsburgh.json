Pittsburgh was first known as the \"City of Champions\" when the\nPittsburgh Pirates\n,\nPittsburgh Panthers football team\n, and\nPittsburgh Steelers\nwon multiple championships in the 1970s.\n[\n1\n]\nToday, the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, and\nPenguins\n; while the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\nPanthers\ncompete in a\nDivision I\nPower Five conference\n, the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities\nDuquesne\nand\nRobert Morris\nalso field Division I teams in men's and women's basketball and\nDivision I FCS\nteams in football. Robert Morris also fields Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams.\nPittsburgh's major teams have seen great success, with the MLB's Pirates winning 5 World Series titles, the NHL's Penguins winning 5 Stanley Cups, and the NFL's Steelers winning a tied league record 6 Super Bowls. The Pittsburgh Panthers have also been successful in the NCAA with 9 national championships in football and 2 in basketball.\nThe flag of Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of\nWilliam Pitt\n's\ncoat of arms\n; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's first\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) franchise, the\nPittsburgh Pirates\n, and that team's non-NHL predecessor, the\nPittsburgh Yellow Jackets\n, wore black and gold as their colors in the 1920s. The colors were adopted by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers,\nArt Rooney\n, in 1933. In 1948, the Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, wore blue and white, due to then-general manager\nJack Riley's\nupbringing in\nOntario\n. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme to match, despite objections from the\nBoston Bruins\n,\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nwho have used the black and gold combination since the\n1935–36 NHL season\n.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nIn 1975, late Steelers\nradio broadcaster\nMyron Cope\ninvented the\nTerrible Towel\n, which has become \"arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team.\"\n[\n6\n]\nCope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and its surrounding area; others include golfer\nArnold Palmer\n, Olympian and retired professional wrestler\nKurt Angle\n, and basketball player\nJack Twyman\n.  Pittsburgh is also sometimes called the \"Cradle of Quarterbacks\"\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\ndue to the number of prominent players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats\nJim Kelly\n,\nGeorge Blanda\n,\nJohnny Unitas\n,\nJoe Namath\n,\nDan Marino\n, and\nJoe Montana\n.\nThe hometown\nPittsburgh Penguins\nNHL\nice hockey\nteam defeats the\nWashington Capitals\nin Game 7 of the\n2017 Stanley Cup playoffs\nsecond round en route to\nwinning the Stanley Cup championship\ntwo rounds later.

The Alleghenies won the game 7–3.\n[\n12\n]\nThe 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 1 game of the pennant in the\nInternational Association\n; only a Canadian team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for being the best American team that season.\n1882 marked the first \"major league\" and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from\nAmerican Association\nto the\nNational League\nafter owner\nWilliam Nimick\nbecame frustrated over a contract dispute.\n[\n13\n]\nThe Pirates were purchased in 1900 by\nBarney Dreyfuss\n, who would go down in history as the \"Father of the modern World Series\" and its precursor, the\nChronicle-Telegraph Cup\n, both of which saw the Pirates participate in the inaugural series. He recruited\nHall of Famers\nFred Clarke\nand Pittsburgh native\nHonus Wagner\nand built the first concrete and steel (first \"modern\") baseball stadium,\nForbes Field\n. Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901–1903, 1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925.  The 1902 squad set major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second most winning team ever fielded in the sport.\n[\n14\n]\nThe franchise won the World Series three more times— in 1960, 1971, and 1979.  In 1960, the team became the first to win a World Series on a walk-off home run, hit by\nBill Mazeroski\n, and they remain the only team to win on a walk-off homer in the decisive seventh game.  In 1979, the Pirates repeated the accomplishment of their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit, winning three games in a row when facing elimination, for the title.  Thus the Pirates became (and they currently remain) the only franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once when coming back from a 3-1 deficit.  The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that they are the only team in all sports to have players who captured all four MVP awards:  Seasonal (\nWillie Stargell\n, co-MVP with Keith Hernandez), All Star Game (\nDave Parker\n), NLCS (Willie Stargell), and World Series (Willie Stargell) within a single season.\n[\n15\n]\nSince 1970 the team has won their division and qualified for the playoffs nine times:  six in the 1970s, and three times in a row from 1990 to 1992.  Pirate players have won the league MVP award in 1960 (\nDick Groat\n), 1966 (\nRoberto Clemente\n), 1978 (Dave Parker), 1979 (Willie Stargell), 1990 (\nBarry Bonds\n), 1992 (Barry Bonds), and 2013 (\nAndrew McCutchen\n) and the Cy Young Award in 1960 (\nVernon Law\n) and 1990 (\nDoug Drabek\n).  In 2001, the team opened\nPNC Park\non the city's\nNorth Shore\n, regularly ranked as one of the top three baseball parks in the country.\nIn addition to the Pirates, the\nPittsburgh Stogies\n,\nPittsburgh Burghers\nand\nPittsburgh Rebels\nplayed in various leagues from 1884 to 1915.  The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915.\n[\n16\n]\nThe\nPittsburgh Keystones\n,\nHomestead Grays\n(playing in the city limits), and\nPittsburgh Crawfords\nplayed in the\nNegro leagues\n. With players including\nJosh Gibson\nand\nCumberland Posey\nthe Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro league team\n[\n1\n]\n—including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage, with a line-up including Gibson,\nCool Papa Bell\n, and\nSatchel Paige\nand claimed four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged by some\n[\nwho?\n]\nas the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro leagues, or perhaps in baseball period.  Just as they initially played in the first \"modern\" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner\nGus Greenlee\nconstructed the first steel and concrete \"modern\" stadium in the Negro leagues, with\nGreenlee Field\nopening in the\nHill District\non April 29, 1932.\n[\n17\n]\nBasketball\n[\nedit\n]\nPittsburgh South Side\nwon Western Pennsylvania Basketball League and\nCentral Basketball League\ntitles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915.  The \"\nBlack Fives\n\" league enjoyed success in the city with\nMonticello-Loendi\nwinning national championships in 1912, and four in a row from 1920–23. The\nPittsburgh Pirates\nfrom 1937–39 and\nPittsburgh Raiders\nin 1944–45 continued professional basketball in the city in the\nNational Basketball League\n. Pittsburgh had one of the founding members of what became the\nNBA\n, the\nPittsburgh Ironmen\nhowever only played a single season 1947–48 before folding.  The\nPittsburgh Renaissance\n(or Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the\nABL\n, posting the city's best record in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962.\nThe most lasting legacy of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the\nPittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors\nof the\nAmerican Basketball Association\nfrom 1967 until 1972.  In the first\nABA World Championship\nin 1968, the Pipers defeated the\nNew Orleans Buccaneers\n, which were owned by\nHarry Connick Sr.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAfter the ABA Pipers/Condors folded in 1972 the city hosted the\nPittsburgh Piranhas\nof the\nCBA\nin the mid-1990s.  The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 season.  Taking the series into the 6th game the Piranhas lost by a basket in the final seconds (92-94) by what they claimed was an ineligible player, the CBA denied a replay game in what would have been Pittsburgh's second pro-basketball world title.\n[1]\nIn the late 2000s the\nPittsburgh Xplosion\n, a development league team owned by former NBA player\nFreddie Lewis\n,\n[\n18\n]\nplayed in a revamped\nABA/CBA\nat\nMellon Arena\nand the\nPetersen Events Center\nbefore ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the\nPittsburgh Phantoms\nof the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, played during the 2009–10 season and held their games at the\nCarnegie Library of Homestead\n, but folded prior to the following season.\nPittsburgh has hosted dozens of pre-season and 15 regular season \"neutral site\" NBA games, including\nWilt Chamberlain\n's record setting performance in both consecutive field goals and field goal percentage on February 24, 1967, NBA records that still stand.\n[\n19\n]\nHockey\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nFlyers–Penguins rivalry\nand\nSports in Philadelphia  § Pittsburgh\nFirst played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice hockey grew in popularity after the\nDuquesne Gardens\nopened in 1899. In 1901 the\nWestern Pennsylvania Hockey League\n(WPHL), a semi-professional ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the\nSchenley Park Casino\nand the\nWinter Garden at Exposition Hall\n. The Casino, which was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium lights. In 1905–1907, the city was represented in the\nInternational Professional Hockey League\n, the first fully professional hockey league, by the\nPittsburgh Professionals\n.\nPittsburgh Civic Arena was replaced by the venue now known as PPG Paints Arena in 2010.\nThe Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the\nPittsburgh Pirates\n, from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the\nPittsburgh Shamrocks\nand the\nPittsburgh Yellow Jackets\nof the\nInternational Hockey League\nas well as the\nPittsburgh Hornets\nof the\nAmerican Hockey League\n.\n[\n20\n]\nIn 1961,\nPittsburgh Civic Arena\nwas constructed for use of the\nPittsburgh Civic Light Opera\n. Founded, by\nJack McGregor\nand\nPeter Block\nas part of the\n1967 NHL expansion\n, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nhave played home games in downtown Pittsburgh since their inception—first at the Civic Arena, and since 2010 at PPG Paints Arena.\n[\n21\n]\nThe Penguins won back-to-back\nStanley Cup\nchampionships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third Stanley Cup in 2009.\n[\n22\n]\nThe teams included players\nMark Recchi\n,\nKevin Stevens\n,\nJaromír Jágr\n, and\nMario Lemieux\n.\n[\n23\n]\nLemieux holds multiple franchise records and was elected to the\nHockey Hall of Fame\nin 1997.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n25\n]\nHe suffered from multiple injuries, including\nHodgkin's lymphoma\n, throughout his career.\n[\n26\n]\nIn 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise from\nbankruptcy\n. He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner of the modern era.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Penguins, led by top point scorers\nEvgeni Malkin\nand\nSidney Crosby\n, returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the franchise's third Cup in 2009.\n[\n28\n]\nThe franchise recorded their fourth and fifth Stanley Cups consecutively in 2016 and 2017.\nFootball\n[\nedit\n]\nOn November 12, 1892,\nPudge Heffelfinger\nwas paid $500 to participate in an American football game for the\nAllegheny Athletic Association\n.

The\nDuquesne Country and Athletic Club\n, was the top pro team in the state in 1898 and 1899. The first ever pro football all-star game was played at\nExposition Park\nbetween the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and a\ncollection of players from several teams in the area\non December 3, 1898.  Duquesne won the game 16–0.  Later the\nHomestead Library & Athletic Club\n, fielded the top pro team in the state in 1900 and 1901. In 1902 the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed the\nPittsburgh Stars\nof the\nfirst National Football League\n. The Stars were suspected of being financed by\nBarney Dreyfuss\nand\nWilliam Chase Temple\n, the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. The team featured baseball players in the line-up including\nChristy Mathewson\n, a future Hall of Fame pitcher with the\nNew York Giants\nand\nFred Crolius\n, and outfielder with Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902.\nIn 1933, as the oldest of nine children\nArt Rooney\n, who had been raised on the\nNorth Side\nof Pittsburgh, founded the\nPittsburgh Steelers\n.\n[\n31\n]\nOriginally nicknamed the Pirates,\n[\n32\n]\nthe team later changed their name to the Steelers, to represent the city's heritage of\nproducing steel\n. The Steelers' first season with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff game in 1947.\n[\n33\n]\nIn 1969, the Steelers hired head coach\nChuck Noll\nwho strategically drafted players in order to improve the team.\n[\n34\n]\nThree years later, in the first playoff game at\nThree Rivers Stadium\nPittsburgh's rookie running back\nFranco Harris\nreturned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for a game-winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the\nImmaculate Reception\n. In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded by\nBill Cowher\n, who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005.\nMike Tomlin\nsucceeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008.\n[\n33\n]\nAs of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members in the\nPro Football Hall of Fame\n.\n[\n35\n]\nIn October 1964,\nErnie Stautner\n, who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers' player to have his number—70—retired.\n[\n36\n]\nCharles \"Mean Joe\" Greene had his number—75—retired in 2014.  In 2008,\nESPN.com\nranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\nSteelers Chairman\nDan Rooney\n, son of founder Art Rooney, became the majority owner of the Steelers in November 2008 along with his son Art II, after they bought all of the shares of two of his four brothers.\n[\n39\n]\nOutside of the NFL, the city was represented by the\nPittsburgh Americans\nof the\nsecond American Football League\nin 1936 and 1937. It was also briefly represented by the\nPittsburgh Maulers\nof the\nUnited States Football League\n, in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (which later became the\nTampa Bay Storm\n), of the\nArena Football League\nfrom 1987 until 1990. A second Arena Football League team, the\nPittsburgh Power\n, played in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014.\n[\n40\n]\nIn addition, Pittsburgh has also been home to women's full-contact football teams.
