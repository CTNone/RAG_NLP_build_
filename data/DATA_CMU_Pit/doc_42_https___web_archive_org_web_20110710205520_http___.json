Dobelle\nWe st fie ld St at e C o lle ge , We st fie ld , M assac h u se t t sIntroduction\n“Saviors of Our Cities: Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships” is an\nextension of Dr. Evan Dobelle’s original survey and ranking of civically engaged\ncolleges and universities that appeared in 2006. “Civic Engagement,” in this sense,\nrefers to the positive economic, social, and cultural impact that institutions of higher\neducation have upon the cities in which they reside. Results illustrate the broad\nrange of engagement initiatives currently being implemented and are designed to\nanalyze the evolution, maturation, and growing sophistication of these efforts which\nhave proven so vital to metropolitan areas across the nation.\nOf note:\n• The final survey ranking does not include colleges and universities that reside in\nsmaller, more traditional “college towns” like Chapel Hill, NC, Lawrence, KS or\nBloomington, IN.\n• At the same time, the ranking reflects institutional engagement impact to scale,\nmeaning that the included institutions implement programs and initiatives that\npositively affect the greater part of their metropolitan areas.\nCircumstances and initiatives vary and the findings of this work document, publicize,\nand advance the unique and innovative means by which concerned and committed\ncolleges and universities forge beneficial and permanent relationships with the\ncommunities in which they reside. The findings also make clear the widening sense\nof partnership among the institutions themselves, as they look to each other for\nguidance and support to advance the cause of civic engagement.\nRankings:\n• They are meant to HIGHLIGHT programs, not to EXCLUDE programs, and we\nencourage the bringing to our attention of any unintentional oversights in our\nresearch at mkonig@wsc.ma.edu.\nMethodology\nThe format of this survey followed the original 10 assessment criteria developed by\nDr. Dobelle for his 2006 work. These criteria are listed on a one-page document\ntitled, “Saviors of Our Cities Survey Criteria”.\nOnsite interviews were conducted by a representative of Westfield State College\nwith the presidents, directors of civic engagement or their designees from many of\nthe institutions mentioned in this survey. While these interviews involved a fraction\nof the colleges and universities committed to civic engagement, they were\nstrategically planned and designed to amass a significant amount of best-practice\n2 Saviors of Our Citiesresearch material from many of the institutions recognized by Dr. Dobelle’s 2006\nsurvey.\nInterviews and evaluation of submitted materials required over a year to complete.\nThe meetings took place on the campuses of these institutions and made possible a\nclear understanding of the unique qualities of engagement from institution to\ninstitution. The personal nature of the interviews also made apparent the growing\nsense of mutual support, which exists among these institutions.\nWith the assistance and support of the American Council on Education (ACE), the\nOffice of the President at Westfield State College sent both documents to the\npresident’s office of almost every college and university in the nation. Once the\nsurvey appeared, the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities (CUMU)\ngraciously offered to include it on its website. This helped to ensure a broad\ninstitutional response.\nAfter assessing the responses, Dr. Dobelle, with the help of his Fellow, Dr. Michael\nKonig, Professor of History and an expert in social research, created this ranking of\nthe Top 25 engaged institutions of higher learning in the country. They based the\nrankings on the qualitative and quantifiable responses to the survey criteria with a\nspecial emphasis placed on how effectively the engaged institution had forged a\ncollaborative vision of a shared future with its community. An alphabetical listing of\n“Honor Roll” institutions is included as well.\nSpecial thanks are extended to those who gave of their time and resources to\nsupport this effort.\nRankings\n1. University of Pennsylvania: Through the Barbara and Edward Netter Center for\nCommunity Partnerships, Penn has transformed the neighborhood schools of\nWest Philadelphia into “environment changing institutions.” Directed by Ira\nHarkavy, the nation’s foremost expert in higher education community\nengagement, the Center conducts a project through which its university-assisted\nschool model has been replicated on a national level. These efforts, combined\nwith an exemplary service learning curriculum and an historic, extensive and\nneighborhood friendly campus expansion program places Penn at the top of this\nlist, tied with University of Southern California.\n1. University of Southern California: Led by its visionary president, Stephen\nSamples, USC implements a remarkably far-reaching engagement program with\na number of components: University Assisted Public Schools, Service Learning,\nSaviors of Our Cities 3Community Partnering with regards to economic, social, and political\nempowerment. USC is a major employer in the Southern California area but it\nalso helps to create an economic environment that attracts creative\nentrepreneurs outside of education and health care. The university accomplishes\nthis through the implementation of a successful “Business Expansion Network”\nmentoring program, which provides start up and continual support to local\nbusinesses endemic to the community. The University of Southern California\nMedical Center coordinates myriad community health programs to needy Los\nAngeles residents.\n2. University of Dayton: UD is perhaps the most innovative of all engaged colleges\nand universities. Its community involvement is steeped in the university’s\nMarianist Catholic tradition of community charity and support, as well as civic\nleadership. UD’s Fitz Center for Leadership in Community embodies this\ncommitment to “faith and justice” and its creative partnering around local\nenvironmental issues captures the positive spirit of engagement. UD’s great\nlesson of engagement is that mutually beneficial partnerships between\ninstitutions of higher learning and their communities are based on the social\ncapital created through respect and the sharing of assets.\n2. University of Pittsburgh: Pitt’s motto is, “The city is our campus,” and through\nan engagement program, which builds upon the historic connection between\ninstitution and metropolitan area, the university has played a key role in helping\nto economically, culturally, and physically revitalize Pittsburgh. Working through\nthe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Pitt created the\nCommunity Outreach Partnership Center, which has leveraged the university’s\nresources in a manner, which supports neighborhood partnerships in order to\naddress neighborhood concerns. The selection of the city as the site of the 2009\nG-20 Summit reflects an urban economy discovering “life after steel.” PITT ARTS\nconnects the university’s students with the city’s emerging and energetic art\nscene. Pitt has set the dimensions and pace of engagement in Pittsburgh. Its\nneighborhood collaborations have resulted in physically and economically\nrevitalized neighborhoods. Neighborhood is the key here. Pitt’s engagement\nbenefits the entire metropolitan region, one neighborhood at a time.\n5. Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis: This state university, in the\nheart of Indianapolis, claims that, “Civic engagement isn’t just what our students,\nfaculty, and staff do; it’s at the heart of who we are….” The institution lives up to\nthis commitment through entities such as the IU Emerging Technologies Center,\nwhich has helped to create myriad high-tech companies and jobs in the area and\nthe Signature Center Service Learning Research Collaborative which “has\nenabled the campus to emerge as a center for research and scholarship on civic\nengagement and service learning.” The university’s own service learning course\nofferings are outstanding and IUPUI makes available a wealth of information to\n4 Saviors of Our Citiesother institutions in regards to constructing service learning curricula. Thus, its\nengagement effect is not only positive for its own students, faculty, and\ncommunity, but for others as well.\n6. Creighton University: The mission of Creighton University and the “renaissance”\nof downtown Omaha have been inextricably linked for many years. Led by its\nscholarly president, Fr. John Schlegel, the university has invested over $225\nmillion in campus improvements designed to erect needed academic facilities\nand to enhance the physical beauty and economic viability of the city. Most\nnotably, Creighton has contributed substantially to the development of Omaha’s\nriverfront and to other long-term urban renewal projects. The Creighton Center\nfor Service and Justice seeks to create a metropolitan community grounded in\nthe Jesuit values of faith, service, and justice. The Creighton University Medical\nCenter remains at its inner-city location in order to provide community health\nprograms and “to serve the poorest areas of the city.”\n7. Case Western Reserve University: Case Western Reserve University describes\nitself as “a community service model, building a beloved community, one\npartnership at a time.” Its Center for Community Partnerships connects the\nuniversity with the Cleveland metropolitan area in many ways i.e., academic,\nhealth-related and social service outreach programs. The Case Western\nSignature Health Programs are particularly remarkable and include the Healthy\nSmiles Sealant Program and School of Nursing Senior Capstone Project. The\nCleveland Math and Science Partnership advances biology, chemistry, physical\nscience, and mathematics knowledge in that city’s public school system.\n8. Tulane University: Tulane University’s engagement efforts are broad with a\nstrong focus on community health care. The university has been heavily engaged\nin ensuring the delivery of primary care to vulnerable populations in the Greater\nNew Orleans area. Since Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, this work includes\ndirect service delivery through sites operated by the university, as well as sites\nwhere the university is the major provider. Tulane School of Medicine faculty\nand residents are involved in more than a dozen community programs\nthroughout the city, and since Katrina have served 67,500 patients. Building\nupon the experiences in the immediate post-hurricane period, Tulane School of\nMedicine changed its mission to “Education, Research, Patient Care: We Heal\nCommunities.\"\n9. Portland State University: PSU defines and measures its economic multiplier\neffect upon the Portland metropolitan area through its role as “employer,\npurchaser, student aid provider, and real estate developer.” PSU’s Center for\nElectron Microscopy and Nanofabrication provides faculty, students, and\ncompanies in the metropolitan area access to some of the most advanced\nequipment for research in the fields of electrical engineering, physics, chemistry,\nSaviors of Our Cities 5biology, and geology. The university has also created one of the finest service\nlearning curricula of any engaged institution, which is integrated both\nhorizontally and vertically and requires a service learning capstone experience of\nevery student.\n10. Drexel University: Drexel’s Entrepreneurship & Technology Commercialization\nOffices works to commercialize Drexel intellectual property and thereby bring\nbenefit and added value to the university and the community. It fosters an\nurban entrepreneurial environment in Philadelphia by licensing technology to\nstart-up or existing companies, assisting faculty and other inventors, and\ndeveloping relationships with early stage venture capital organizations and with\nlocal industry to explore mutual opportunities. Drexel is leading the way for the\nrejuvenation of the four-mile long Lancaster Avenue Corridor and partnered with\nPenn to jointly, academically and physically, revitalize an entire destination\ncalled “University City.” In addition, they have extended their presence in\nPhiladelphia with the acquisition and expansion of the Center City campus of\nHahnemann Medical School (now the Drexel Medical School).\n11. Virginia Commonwealth University: VCU is implementing a nationally\nrecognized engagement program that coalesces around what it terms, “VCU\nCommunity Solutions.” In 2007 VCU celebrated its 40th anniversary by\npresenting “40 Acts of Caring” awards to projects, activities, or initiatives that\npartnered VCU employees, students or alumni with local, regional or\nnational/international communities. Among these projects is the Carver-VCU\nPartnership. Carver is the community, which borders the University on the\nnorth. The Partnership is designed to “create a shared urban community with a\ncommitment to improving the neighborhood’s quality of life including its health,\ncommunity development, youth development, safety and neighborhood school,\nwhile extending the experience of the community into the classroom and the\nuniversity.” The Council for Community Engagement coordinates and supports\ncommunity-based research, teaching and service between VCU and its\ncommunity. The Council members represent all academic and major support\nunits of the University and the VCU Medical Center.\n12. University of Louisville: Through its Signature Partnership Initiative, U of L is\ncommitted to “improving lives in West Louisville.” The university possesses one\nof the most remarkable employee-giving campaigns (U of L Cares) in the country.\nMoney from this campaign supports a variety of community organizations,\nincluding Fund for the Arts, Metro United Way, Crusade for Children, the Kosair\nCharities, and Community Health Charities of Kentucky. U of L has committed\nland and $1.5 million dollars to help build an apartment, which will serve as a\nchild development center for both residents and the university. The university\nalso manages 12 endowment accounts, which provide funding for community\n6 Saviors of Our Citiesengagement initiatives in the areas of family therapy, legal assistance, music,\nworkforce development, dental care, and education.\n13. University of Rochester: The U of R coordinates it civic engagement efforts\nthrough it Community Service Network. In addition to developing service\nopportunities, the CSN seeks to raise awareness of community issues through\nregular events and projects throughout the year. The goal is to give students a\ncontext to frame their service and to help the university population to recognize\nthe challenges faced by their own Rochester community, as well as the many\npositive attributes Rochester has to offer, and ultimately to foster long-term\nengagement and a sense of commitment. The University of Rochester Medical\nCenter embraces a comprehensive approach to community health, which\nemploys the multidisciplinary skills found in an academic medical center to both\nprovide important community services and conduct community-based research.\nThese activities help inform policymakers and the community about local health\nchallenges; evaluate the effectiveness of interventions; and serve as a\nfoundation for evidence-based practices to improve health and overall quality of\nlife.\n14. University of Missouri at Kansas City: UMKC has established a nationally\nrecognized engagement program, which is implemented through its Center for\nEconomic Information, Innovation Center, Small Business and Technology\nDevelopment Center, and Architecture Urban Planning and Design program.\nThese entities provide considerable support to several non-profits,\nneighborhood improvement associations, and local business. The university\nserves almost 3,000 businesses, launching new ones, and creating hundreds of\nnew jobs within the Kansas City metropolitan area. UMKC is also vitally involved\nin improving the city’s Southtown and Brush Creek neighborhoods as well as\nproviding pro bono technical assistance to the city of New Orleans to assist with\nits recovery efforts.\n14. University of Missouri at St. Louis: UMSL’s impressive engagement efforts are\noriented toward social service and community health. Several university centers\ncoordinate this engagement. They include the Center for Trauma Recovery,\nCommunity Psychological Services, Children’s Advocacy Services of Greater St.\nLouis, Shear Institute for Women in Public Life, the University Child Development\nCenter, and the University Eye Center. All provide community-wide support and\nestablish UMSL as one of the most important community service providers in any\nmetropolitan area in the country.\n14. University of Houston: UH’s engagement strength is manifested in its industrial\nand business community partnerships. The university’s Small Business\nDevelopment Network offers fledgling Houston entrepreneurs startup seminars,\nfunding solutions, business loan packaging, as well as access to attorney and\nSaviors of Our Cities 7accountant services. The Center for Industrial Partnerships fosters joint\ninitiatives between Houston companies and the university’s research and\neducational resources in order “to help solve technological challenges involved\nin the commercialization process.” The CIP’s mission is to “speed translation of\nresearch into commercial applications, while training the workforce of\ntomorrow.”\n17. Emory University: Emory’s collaborative metropolitan engagement regarded by\nmany as one of the most forward looking in the nation. Its community health\ncare programs alone are extraordinary. Emory Healthcare is the largest and most\ncomprehensive health system in Georgia. Physicians within Emory Healthcare\nprovide expertise through 4.7 million patient visits a year, at more than 20\nfacilities throughout the metro area. Emory Healthcare provided $29.2 million in\ncharity care in fiscal year 2008, along with $72 million to teaching and research\nmissions in health sciences at Emory. Emory faculty provided $21.4 million in\nunreimbursed care in 2008 at the publicly owned Grady Memorial Hospital.\nEmory Healthcare has more than 10,000 employees, and accounts for a\nsignificant portion of the WHSC's estimated annual $5.5 billion economic impact\non metro Atlanta.\n18. University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee: Through its unique academic programs\nand engagement entities, UWM plays a prominent and positive role in the\nMilwaukee metropolitan area. The university offers a Masters in Urban Planning\n(one of only two accredited in the country) that allows faculty and students to\nconnect and support city planning and revitalization efforts. Its Office of\nNeighborhood Relations (one of the most innovative of all institutions of higher\nlearning) works to enhance the quality of life for permanent residents who live in\nneighborhoods surrounding the UWM campus. The UWM Research Foundation\nworks closely with the UWM Office of Technology Transfer to support\ncollaborative research and technology transfer to the local public and private\nsector.\n19. Carnegie Mellon University: The Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning\nand Outreach coordinates and makes public much of CMU’s community\nengagement efforts. These include Strategies for Engineering Education, which\nprovides middle-school girls with an opportunity to spend two weeks every year\nin “hands-on, multidisciplinary engineering activities focusing on the theme of\nenergy.” Its Summer Academy for Mathematics and Science prepares high\nschool students for the rigorous curriculum they will face as college engineering,\nscience, and mathematics majors. The university emphasizes the similarities\nbetween engineering and music and thus its School of Music, through its\nKeyboard and Drumming Projects, seeks to enhance music instruction in the\nPittsburg Public Schools. Its powerful engineering and design schools have been\ninstrumental in hundreds of “start-up” companies.\n8 Saviors of Our Cities20. Rhode Island School of Design: Rhode Island School of Design supports a student\ndriven public arts initiative, which involves students and faculty with important\neconomic, social, and cultural issues. This initiative links RISD to entities such as\nthe U.S. Coast Guard (boat design), the Robert Kennedy Mental Health Initiative,\nand the Providence Police Department (improved police car design). These\nengagement efforts also include international dimensions, such as participation\nin the Earth University in Costa Rica, and Sustainable Development in Ghana.\nRISD continues to serve as the catalyst and anchor tenant in the revitalization of\nProvidence for the past decade.\n21. Miami-Dade College: MDC’s four-year academic engagement efforts reflect the\nmission of a community college; that of providing access to a wide-range of\nstudents. Access at MDC is augmented and spurred by a broad range of service\nlearning courses and a well-conceived curriculum. What makes these efforts\nspecial is that they are founded upon the institution’s cultural ties to the diverse\npopulation of the Miami metropolitan region. Cultural programs serve as the\nnexus between institution, potential students, and the larger community. MDC\nis a multi-campus institution, which constitutes multi-institutional and positive\neconomic, social, and cultural impact upon the many unique neighborhoods\nthroughout Miami.\n22. St. Louis University: St. Louis University reflects the best of the Jesuit devotion\nto the inner city poor. Foregoing an opportunity to move to a suburban location,\nthe university chose to remain and help revitalize downtown St. Louis. The\nuniversity has created a remarkable community service institution in the form of\nthe Micah Program. This program and its emerging Center for Service and\nCommunity Engagement effectively links administrative, faculty, and student\nresources with a variety of community partners. Its Doerr Center for Social\nJustice Education and Research is funded by a multi-million dollar endowment\nfor research and student engagement, which largely focuses on the urban poor.\nThe university has also purchased and renovated several downtown buildings\nand has collaborated with Washington University to establish a center city\n“Biotech Corridor” of research and development and high-tech firms.\n23. Rutgers-Newark, State University of New Jersey: Chancellor Stephen Diner has\ncharted a course for RN which builds upon the university’s historic community\nengagement tradition. This engagement includes local small business support,\ncontributions to the creative arts (including the publication of the Newark Metro,\nwhich reports on metropolitan life in the North Jersey/New York metropolitan\narea), pre-college initiatives focused on creating greater access for local\nresidents, innovative programs coordinated by the Center for Information\nManagement, Integration, and Connectivity, and community legal clinics. Its\nSaviors of Our Cities 9efforts on the “turn-around” of historic Washington Square into a contemporary\n‘Greenwich Village’ is visionary and currently in progress.\n24. George Washington University: Through its Center for Excellence in Public\nLeadership, GWU supports “strong city agent management as well as\ncommunity-based economic and social progress in the District of Columbia.” The\nuniversity has established a remarkably positive dialogue with its neighbors\nthrough its FRIENDS group. GWU created this entity to ensure that its campus\nexpansion plans positively impact local residents. For several years GWU\nstudents, faculty, and staff have worked through FRIENDS to host monthly\nmeetings and a large community celebration which bring “together local\nbusiness, restaurants, groups, and institutions.” The GW Hospital provides care\nto thousands of DC residents as well as surveying city health trends. This allows\nthe local government to focus its attention on treating the health problems that\nGW has identified, especially those among at-risk populations. GWU’s\ncommunity relations staff is talented and possesses tremendous energy. This\nenergy is necessary to match the fast-paced tempo of urban life in the nation’s\nCapital.\n25. University of Nebraska-Omaha: Community engagement is one of three over-\narching strategic goals included in the UNO’s strategic plan. This commitment is\nreflected in the university’s College of Public Affairs and Community Service.\nHome to UNO’s programs of Social Work, Criminal Justice, and Public\nAdministration, the COPA is nationally recognized for preparing students and\nprofessionals for careers in public service. The university also partners with the\nMetropolitan Omaha Education Consortium and the Nebraska Business\nDevelopment Center. UNO’s service learning offerings are extraordinary. Its\nService Learning Academy and faculty coordinate community engagement\nprojects in over 110 courses that enroll almost 2000 students each year.\n10 Saviors of Our CitiesHonor Roll\nLike the top 25 institutions, there are many other colleges and universities that have\nfigured prominently in lengthy cooperative efforts with community leaders to\nrehabilitate the cities around them, using their money and expertise to further the\nprojects.
